# UI Features Implementation Complete

## Overview
As requested, I've completed the missing UI features identified during the repository audit. All three major features have been implemented with full interactive functionality.

## Completed Features

### 1. Organization Chart Builder (`/web/org-chart.html`)
- **Interactive Visualization**: Built with vis-network.js for dynamic org structure mapping
- **Key Features**:
  - Drag-and-drop hierarchy builder
  - Role-based color coding (Executive, Director, Manager, Staff)
  - Pre-built templates for different institution sizes
  - Export to PNG and JSON
  - Compliance coverage analysis
  - Real-time node/edge statistics
- **Status**: ✅ Complete (requires backend API: `/api/v1/org-chart`)

### 2. Scenario Modeling & ROI Calculator (`/web/scenario-modeling.html`)
- **Comprehensive ROI Analysis**: Built with Chart.js for data visualization
- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic input sliders for institution parameters
  - Real-time ROI calculations
  - 5-year projection charts
  - Detailed savings breakdown by category
  - Scenario templates (Small, Medium, Large, Enterprise)
  - Export functionality
  - Break-even analysis
- **Status**: ✅ Complete (requires backend API: `/api/v1/scenarios`)

### 3. Enterprise Dashboard (`/web/enterprise-dashboard.html`)
- **Executive Analytics View**: Comprehensive metrics and insights
- **Key Features**:
  - Key performance metrics cards
  - Department performance tracking
  - Compliance calendar with deadlines
  - Recent activity feed
  - Power BI embed placeholder (with setup instructions)
  - Time range selectors
- **Status**: ✅ Complete (requires Power BI configuration)

### 4. Dashboard Navigation Update (`/web/dashboard.html`)
- **Enhanced Navigation**: Added new section for advanced features
- **Updates**:
  - Added "Advanced Features" grid section
  - Links to all three new pages
  - Maintained existing quick actions
  - Fixed character encoding issues (A³E → A³E)

## Next Steps

### Backend API Implementation Needed:
1. **Org Chart API** (`/api/v1/org-chart`)
   - POST: Save org structure
   - GET: Retrieve saved structures
   - PUT: Update existing structures

2. **Scenarios API** (`/api/v1/scenarios`)
   - POST: Save scenario configurations
   - GET: List saved scenarios
   - GET /{id}: Retrieve specific scenario

3. **Enterprise Metrics API** (`/api/v1/metrics/enterprise`)
   - GET: Real-time compliance metrics
   - GET /departments: Department performance data

### Environment Variables Needed:
```env
# Power BI Integration
POWERBI_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
POWERBI_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
POWERBI_TENANT_ID=your_tenant_id
POWERBI_WORKSPACE_ID=your_workspace_id
POWERBI_REPORT_ID=your_report_id

# Single Plan Stripe Price ID
STRIPE_SINGLE_PLAN_PRICE_ID=price_xxxx
```

## Technical Stack Used
- **Visualization Libraries**:
  - vis-network.js (v9.1.2) - Org chart network visualization
  - Chart.js (v3.9.1) - ROI charts and projections
- **UI Framework**: Tailwind CSS (consistent with existing design)
- **Icons**: Heroicons (inline SVG)

## Access Points
All features are accessible from the main dashboard:
1. Navigate to `/web/dashboard.html`
2. Look for the "Advanced Features" section
3. Click on any feature card to access

## Notes
- All UI features have full client-side functionality
- Save operations attempt to call backend APIs (will show errors until implemented)
- Power BI integration requires Azure AD app registration
- All pages include responsive design for mobile/tablet access

The platform now has complete UI coverage for all features mentioned in the blueprint. The backend API implementation is the final piece needed to persist data and enable full functionality.
