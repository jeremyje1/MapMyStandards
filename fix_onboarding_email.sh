- Store user email in localStorage/sessionStorage on login
- Use keys that onboarding page expects (a3e_user_email, a3e_pending_email)
- Update logout to preserve email data for better user experience
- Fixes 'We could not detect your signup email' warning

This ensures onboarding can properly save user progress."
