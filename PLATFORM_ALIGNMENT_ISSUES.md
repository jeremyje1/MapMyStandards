# Platform Alignment Issues - MapMyStandards

## Current Status
The platform has authentication working but the dashboard and other features are not accessible due to a mismatch between authentication systems.

## Key Issues Found

### 1. Authentication System Mismatch
- **Auth Routes** (`/auth/login`, `/auth/register`): Use in-memory storage (`users_db` dictionary)
- **Dashboard Routes** (`/api/dashboard/*`): Expect users in PostgreSQL/SQLite database
- **Result**: Users can login but cannot access any dashboard features

### 2. Frontend/Backend Endpoint Misalignment
- Frontend expects `/auth/me` but backend has `/auth/verify-token`
- Frontend expects `/dashboard/overview` but backend has `/api/dashboard/overview`
- These have been partially fixed in the frontend code

### 3. Database Schema Issues
- Dashboard expects a `User` model with fields like:
  - `is_active`
  - `is_trial`
  - `is_trial_active`
- Auth system creates users with different fields

## Test Results
```
✅ Login successful (creates in-memory user)
✅ Token verification works
❌ Dashboard overview - 401 Invalid or expired token
❌ Dashboard analytics - 401 Invalid or expired token  
❌ Metrics dashboard - 500 Failed to retrieve dashboard metrics
```

## What Needs to Be Fixed

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended for Demo)
1. Modify auth routes to save users to the database
2. Ensure JWT token validation uses the same secret across all routes
3. Add the missing user fields when creating accounts

### Option 2: Complete Alignment (For Production)
1. Unify the authentication system to use one storage mechanism
2. Implement proper user management with database models
3. Ensure all routes use consistent authentication
4. Add proper error handling and logging

## Test Account Created
- Email: testuser@example.com  
- Password: TestPassword123!
- Status: Can login but cannot access dashboard

## Next Steps
To make the platform fully functional:

1. **Backend Changes Needed**:
   - Modify `/auth/register` to save to database
   - Modify `/auth/login` to check database
   - Ensure consistent JWT secret usage
   - Add missing user fields

2. **Frontend Changes Made**:
   - ✅ Updated API endpoints to match backend
   - ✅ Fixed authentication flow
   - Pending: Handle error responses properly

3. **Deployment**:
   - Backend needs to be redeployed with fixes
   - Frontend build is ready but needs backend fixes first

## Conclusion
The platform's authentication works but is disconnected from the main application features. A backend update is required to align the authentication system with the database-dependent features like dashboard, compliance checking, and document management.
