## 🌐 Deployment Status

### Backend (Railway) - api.mapmystandards.ai
- **Status:** ✅ LIVE (degraded but functional)
- **Uptime:** 527,783 seconds (~6.1 days)
- **Version:** 0.1.0
- **Environment:** production

#### Service Health
```json
{
  "database": "✅ healthy (9.46ms)",
  "vector_db": "✅ healthy (75.3ms)",
  "llm_service": "⚠️ unhealthy (55.01ms)",
  "agent_orchestrator": "⚠️ unavailable",
  "analytics_consistency": "⚠️ skipped"
}
```

**Note:** Core services are healthy. LLM service degradation is non-critical for basic operations.

### Frontend (Vercel) - platform.mapmystandards.ai
- **Status:** ✅ LIVE
- **Auto-Deployment:** Triggered by GitHub Actions
- **Expected Completion:** ~2-5 minutes from push

---

## 🔄 Automated Deployment Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Triggered
1. **Railway Deploy** - `.github/workflows/railway_deploy.yml`
   - Backend API deployment to Railway
   - Health check at `/health` endpoint

2. **Vercel Deploy** - `.github/workflows/vercel_deploy.yml`
   - Frontend static site deployment
   - CDN distribution and caching

### Monitor Progress
🔗 **GitHub Actions:** https://github.com/jeremyje1/MapMyStandards/actions

## 📊 Pre-Deployment State

### Working Tree Status
```
✅ Clean working tree
✅ No uncommitted changes
✅ Branch synced with origin/main
✅ All files properly tracked or ignored
```

### Previous Deployment
- **Last Commit:** `578035f` (6 days ago)
- **Message:** "feat: run security validator during startup"
- **Status:** Successfully deployed and operational

---

## 🎯 Deployment Verification

### Backend Verification
```bash
curl https://api.mapmystandards.ai/health
```
**Result:** ✅ Responding (degraded but operational)

### Frontend Verification
```bash
curl -I https://platform.mapmystandards.ai
```
**Result:** ✅ Responding with 308 redirect to /login.html

---

## 📝 Important Notes

### What Changed
- ✅ Added comprehensive deployment status documentation
- ✅ No code changes (documentation only)
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ No database migrations required

### Security Considerations
1. **All secrets protected** - No credentials in repository
2. **Pre-commit hooks active** - Preventing accidental secret commits
3. **GitHub Secrets secure** - Railway and Vercel tokens in GitHub Secrets
4. **Environment variables** - All sensitive data in Railway/Vercel dashboards

### Known Issues (Pre-existing)
- ⚠️ **LLM Service:** Currently unhealthy (non-critical for basic ops)
- ⚠️ **Agent Orchestrator:** Unavailable (disabled for memory optimization)
- ⚠️ **Analytics Consistency:** Skipped (no uploads to evaluate)

These are **expected limitations** documented in BUILD_STATE.json and do not affect core functionality.

## ✨ Deployment Success Criteria

### ✅ All Criteria Met
- [x] Code committed to main branch
- [x] Security scans passed
- [x] No secrets exposed
- [x] Git push successful
- [x] GitHub Actions triggered
- [x] Backend API responding
- [x] Frontend site accessible
- [x] Documentation updated

---

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Checks

### Recommended Verification (After 5 minutes)
1. **Check GitHub Actions** - Ensure all workflows completed successfully
2. **Test Backend API** - Verify health endpoint responds
3. **Test Frontend** - Verify site loads and redirects work
4. **Check Railway Logs** - Review for any deployment errors
5. **Check Vercel Logs** - Verify build and deployment succeeded

### Commands for Manual Verification
```bash
# Backend health check
curl https://api.mapmystandards.ai/health | jq

# Frontend status check
curl -I https://platform.mapmystandards.ai

# Check recent git history
git log --oneline -5

# Verify current branch
git status
```
