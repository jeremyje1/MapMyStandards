# URGENT: Deploy Required

## The Fix Has NOT Been Deployed

The production server is still running the old code with the broken `run_in_executor` implementation. 

### Current Production Error:
```
run_in_executor() got an unexpected keyword argument 'email'
```

### Fix Already Applied Locally:
In `src/a3e/services/payment_service.py`, line 75:
```python
# Fixed version (not yet deployed):
return await loop.run_in_executor(None, lambda: func(*f_args, **f_kwargs))
```

## Deploy Steps

1. **Commit and Push the Fix**:
```bash
git add src/a3e/services/payment_service.py
git commit -m "Fix run_in_executor kwargs handling for Python 3.8 compatibility"
git push origin main
```

2. **Deploy to Production**:
   - If using Railway: Push will auto-deploy
   - If using manual deployment: Run your deployment script
   - If using Docker: Rebuild and redeploy the container

3. **Verify After Deployment**:
   - Check: `https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/api/v1/billing/trial/last-failure`
   - Try a trial signup
   - The error should be different or signup should succeed

## Additional Issues to Address

1. **Form Validation Errors**: The trial signup form has required fields (cardholder_name, billing_address, billing_zip) that are not visible in step 1, causing validation failures.

2. **Tailwind CDN Warning**: Still being loaded from somewhere, though not found in static files.

But first, **DEPLOY THE FIX** to resolve the blocking error!
