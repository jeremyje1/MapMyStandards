# Upload Working Status

## Current Situation
The backend documents API has been fixed but is still deploying. In the meantime, I've created a working upload page that uses the existing functional endpoints.

## Working Upload Page
Visit: https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/upload-working.html

This page uses the `/api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads` endpoints which are:
- ✅ Already deployed and working
- ✅ Support file upload to S3
- ✅ List user's uploaded files
- ✅ Download files
- ✅ Delete files

## Features
1. **Drag & Drop Upload** - Drag files directly onto the upload zone
2. **Multiple File Support** - Upload multiple files at once
3. **Progress Indication** - Visual feedback during upload
4. **File Management** - View, download, and delete uploaded files
5. **Success Notifications** - Clear feedback for all actions

## Next Steps
Once the backend fully deploys (usually 2-3 minutes after push):
1. The enhanced documents API at `/api/documents/*` will be available
2. The main upload page at `/upload` will start working
3. Both will provide the same functionality

## Technical Details
The working page uses:
- **Upload**: `POST /api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads`
- **List**: `GET /api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads`
- **Download**: `GET /api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads/{id}`
- **Delete**: `DELETE /api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads/{id}`

All with proper JWT authentication from the login session.
