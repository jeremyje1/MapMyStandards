# Evidence Library Fix Complete âœ…

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JavaScript Error: `getSelectedStandards is not defined`
- **Problem**: Function was being called but never defined
- **Solution**: Added the missing function to return selected standards as an array
- **Impact**: Evidence Library can now properly check for mapped evidence

### 2. API Error: `/api/user/profile` returning 404
- **Problem**: User profile endpoint not available in current deployment
- **Solution**: Modified code to use localStorage data instead of API call
- **Impact**: User display name now shows properly without API errors

### 3. Evidence Documents Not Loading
- **Problem**: Wrong API endpoint `/api/uploads/recent`
- **Solution**: Updated to use correct endpoint `/api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads`
- **Impact**: Documents should now load properly in Evidence Library

### 4. Login Redirect Issue
- **Problem**: Redirecting to `/login-platform.html` instead of the enhanced login
- **Solution**: Updated to redirect to `/login-enhanced-v2.html`
- **Impact**: Consistent login experience across the platform

## Testing Steps

1. Clear browser cache (important!)
2. Log in at: https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/login-enhanced-v2.html
3. Navigate to: https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/standards-modern.html
4. Click "Evidence Library" button
5. Your uploaded documents should now appear

## What to Expect

- No more console errors about `getSelectedStandards`
- No more 404 errors for `/api/user/profile`
- Evidence Library should show your documents
- Total Documents count should reflect actual uploads
- Search and filtering should work properly

## If Issues Persist

1. Make sure you're logged in with valid JWT token
2. Check browser console for any new errors
3. Try uploading a new document to test the flow

The Evidence Library is now properly integrated with the authentication system and should display all your uploaded documents correctly.
