# ✅ 422 Error Fix - RESOLVED

## Issue
API call to `api.mapmystandards.ai/auth/register` was returning a 422 error status.

## Root Cause
The `/auth/register` endpoint requires these fields:
- `first_name` (required)
- `last_name` (required) 
- `email` (required)
- `password` (required)
- `institution_name` (required)

But the `trial-signup-flow.html` page was only collecting an email address and trying to register without the other required fields.

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Immediate Redirect Fix
- **Added**: JavaScript redirect in `trial-signup-flow.html`
- **Effect**: Any user accessing trial-signup-flow.html now gets immediately redirected to `/register`
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed

### 2. Homepage Flow (Already Fixed)
- **Updated**: Homepage JavaScript redirects to `/register` instead of trial-signup-flow.html
- **Status**: ✅ Already deployed

### 3. React Register Component
- **Enhanced**: Pre-fills form data from URL parameters
- **Status**: ✅ Already deployed

## Current User Flow ✅

1. **Homepage**: User clicks "Start Free Trial"
2. **Modal**: User enters email
3. **Redirect**: Automatically goes to `/register?email=...&plan=...`
4. **Register Page**: React form pre-filled with email and plan
5. **Complete**: User fills in remaining fields (name, password, institution)
6. **Success**: Registration uses working `/auth/register` with all required fields

## Immediate Action for Users

If you're still seeing the 422 error:

1. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Go directly to**: https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/register
3. **Or start fresh from**: https://api.mapmystandards.ai

## Verification

Test the fixed flow:
```
1. Visit: https://api.mapmystandards.ai
2. Click: "Start Free Trial"
3. Enter: Your email address
4. Should redirect to: https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/register?email=...
5. Complete the form with all required fields
6. Registration should succeed
```

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The 422 error has been eliminated by ensuring all registration attempts go through the working React register page with complete form data.
