# Power BI & Advanced Analytics Claim Review

**Last updated:** 2025-10-09

## Summary
Marketing materials on `mapmystandards.ai` previously claimed support for “Power BI reports” and “advanced analytics.” The current production platform does **not** deliver Power BI dashboards, PBIX exports, or advanced analytics tooling. Available customer-facing exports are limited to:

- Evidence downloads (source documents)
- Narrative reports in PDF and HTML formats

## Risk Assessment
- **Customer Trust:** High risk of customer dissatisfaction or churn when advertised capabilities are unavailable.
- **Sales & Legal Exposure:** Potential false advertising concerns if claims are left uncorrected.
- **Support Load:** Increased support inquiries to clarify unavailable features.

## Immediate Mitigations
- Updated `web/homepage-enhanced.html` to mark Power BI integration and advanced analytics as roadmap items and clarified the currently supported exports.
- Aligned copy now communicates:
  - Power BI integration is in development, targeting PBIX-ready datasets.
  - Current analytics consist of narrative summaries with citation support.

## Recommended Follow-Up Actions
1. **Marketing & Sales Enablement**
   - Refresh all external collateral, slide decks, and sales scripts to match the revised messaging.
   - Communicate the change with customer-facing teams to set proper expectations.

2. **Product Roadmap Decision**
   - Decide whether to prioritize building Power BI export datasets and analytics dashboards.
   - If prioritized, produce a product spec covering dataset schemas, refresh cadence, authentication, and UI surfacing.

3. **Customer Communication**
   - Notify active prospects and customers of the clarified roadmap via email or in-app notice.
   - Offer alternatives (e.g., structured CSV exports) where feasible.

## Appendices
- **Source Updates:** `web/homepage-enhanced.html`
- **Current Deliverables:** PDF/HTML narrative reports, evidence downloads
