# Marketing Messaging Sync Plan

**Prepared for:** Marketing & Growth Team  
**Last updated:** 2025-10-09  
**Owner:** Product/RevOps (contact: jeremy.estrella@mapmystandards.ai)

## Objectives
- Ensure all public-facing collateral reflects the clarified status of Power BI integration and advanced analytics.
- Provide customer-facing teams with consistent language that matches the current product capabilities (PDF/HTML reports and evidence exports).
- Reduce risk of misinformation in sales cycles and public communications.

## Key Messages (Effective Immediately)
1. **Current Analytics Deliverables:** PDF and HTML narrative reports, evidence downloads, and citation-supported summaries.
2. **Power BI Integration:** In development; targeted to deliver PBIX-ready datasets once released.
3. **Advanced Analytics:** Future roadmap includes dashboards and predictive analytics; not available in production today.

## Core Assets Requiring Updates
| Asset Type | Owner | Update Needed |
|------------|-------|----------------|
| Website pages (`web/homepage-enhanced.html`, landing pages, pricing) | Web/Marketing | Verify wording reflects roadmap status for Power BI and advanced analytics. |
| Slide decks (sales, investor, demo) | Marketing Ops | Replace claims of "Power BI reports" with roadmap messaging; highlight current exports. |
| One-pagers and brochures | Content Marketing | Update feature sections to clarify roadmap vs delivered features. |
| Email nurture sequences | Demand Gen | Adjust automation copy to remove Power BI promises until feature launch. |
| Demo scripts & talk tracks | Sales Enablement | Provide revised phrasing (see “Enablement Assets” below). |
| Support macros / knowledge base | Customer Success | Ensure support responses outline available export formats and roadmap. |

## Communication Timeline
1. **Day 0 (Today):**
   - Share this plan plus the gap analysis (`docs/POWER_BI_ANALYTICS_GAP.md`).
   - Post announcement in #go-to-market Slack channel.
2. **Day 1-2:**
   - Marketing updates web copy, landing pages, and email templates.
   - Sales enablement distributes revised talk track.
3. **Day 3:**
   - CS updates support macros and help center.
   - Run spot-check across updated collateral.
4. **Day 4+:**
   - Monitor inbound inquiries for questions about Power BI/analytics.
   - Capture feedback for future roadmap planning.

## Enablement Assets
### 1. Slack Announcement Template
```
:mega: Heads-up, team! We’ve aligned our external messaging with current analytics capabilities.

### 2. Sales Talk Track (Snippet)
- **Objection:** “Do you integrate with Power BI?”
- **Response:** “We’re actively working toward Power BI exports by packaging PBIX-ready datasets. Today, customers receive fully cited PDF/HTML narratives and evidence exports, which cover immediate accreditation reporting needs.”

### 3. Customer Email Template
```
Subject: Update on MapMyStandards Analytics Deliverables

Hello {{first_name}},

We’re aligning our analytics messaging to highlight what’s available today versus what’s coming next. You’ll now see updated language across our site clarifying that:

• Today: PDF/HTML accreditation narratives and evidence exports are ready to download.
• Coming soon: PBIX-ready datasets for Power BI dashboards and expanded analytics views.

If you’re interested in early access to the Power BI integration, let us know—we’d love to involve you in the roadmap.

Best,
