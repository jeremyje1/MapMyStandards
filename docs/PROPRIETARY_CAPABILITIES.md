# A³E Proprietary Capabilities

## Overview

The A³E (Autonomous Accreditation & Audit Engine) system has been enhanced with **four proprietary capabilities** that provide significant competitive advantages in the accreditation compliance market:

## 1. Proprietary Accreditation Ontology + Embeddings Schema

### Accreditation Ontology
- **Hierarchical concept framework** with 500+ accreditation-specific concepts
- **8 core domains**: Mission/Governance, Academic Programs, Student Success, Faculty Resources, Institutional Effectiveness, Financial Resources, Infrastructure, Compliance/Ethics
- **Semantic relationships** between concepts with parent-child hierarchies
- **Accreditor-specific mappings** for SACSCOC, HLC, MSCHE, NEASC, WASC, etc.
- **Evidence requirement specifications** for each concept
- **Synonyms and related concepts** for comprehensive coverage

### Proprietary Embeddings Schema (512 dimensions)
- **Semantic core** (256 dims): Base semantic understanding
- **Domain-specific dimensions** (284 dims): Mission (32), Academic (48), Student (40), Faculty (36), Effectiveness (44), Financial (28), Infrastructure (24), Compliance (32)
- **Meta dimensions** (72 dims): Temporal (16), Complexity (8), Criticality (8), Context (16)

**Location**: `src/a3e/core/accreditation_ontology.py`

## 2. Vector-Weighted Standards-Matching Algorithm

### Multi-Factor Scoring System
- **Semantic similarity** (35%): Cosine similarity using proprietary embeddings
- **Ontology hierarchy** (25%): Parent-child and related concept relationships
- **Domain relevance** (20%): Cross-domain compatibility matrix
- **Evidence alignment** (15%): Evidence type compatibility scoring
- **Temporal relevance** (5%): Time-based decay and assessment frequency

### Matching Strategies
- **Exact Semantic**: High precision semantic matching
- **Inferential**: Medium precision with inference requirements
- **Cross-Domain**: Low precision cross-domain synthesis
- **Emergent Pattern**: Complex pattern recognition

### Quality Metrics
- **Confidence scoring**: Weighted combination of all factors
- **Complexity classification**: Direct, Inferential, Synthetic, Emergent
- **Reliability scoring**: Consistency-based validation
- **Performance analytics**: Comprehensive matching statistics

**Location**: `src/a3e/core/vector_matching.py`

## 3. Multi-Agent LLM Pipeline

### Four-Agent Orchestration (Mapper → GapFinder → Narrator → Verifier)

#### 1. Mapper Agent
- **Function**: Classifies artifacts to standards using vector matching + LLM validation
- **Process**: Vector-weighted matching → LLM reasoning enhancement → Confidence adjustment
- **Output**: Enhanced standard mappings with reasoning

#### 2. GapFinder Agent  
- **Function**: Identifies missing evidence and gaps with severity scoring
- **Process**: Coverage analysis → Gap classification → Severity scoring → Recommendations
- **Output**: Identified gaps with criticality levels and action plans

#### 3. Narrator Agent
- **Function**: Drafts prose paragraphs and comprehensive narratives
- **Process**: Domain grouping → Evidence synthesis → Professional narrative generation
- **Output**: Accreditation-ready prose with proper citations

#### 4. Verifier Agent
- **Function**: Validates citations with ≥0.85 cosine similarity requirement
- **Process**: Citation verification → Semantic alignment check → LLM validation
- **Output**: Verified citations with confidence scores

### Pipeline Features
- **Sequential and parallel processing** modes
- **Agent output quality scoring** with error detection
- **Complete context preservation** throughout pipeline
- **Error handling and recovery** mechanisms

**Location**: `src/a3e/core/multi_agent_pipeline.py`

## 4. Audit-Ready Traceability System

### Immutable Audit Trail
- **SQLite-based storage** with integrity hashing
- **Complete LLM interaction capture**: Prompts, responses, token usage
- **Evidence-to-output mapping** with confidence tracking
- **Agent processing traceability** with full context
- **Chain integrity validation** with scoring

### Traceability Levels
- **Minimal**: Basic event logging
- **Standard**: Standard audit requirements (default)
- **Comprehensive**: Full forensic traceability
- **Forensic**: Maximum detail for legal review

### Audit Event Types
- Pipeline execution events
- Agent processing events  
- LLM interaction events
- Evidence mapping events
- Gap identification events
- Narrative generation events
- Citation verification events
- Report generation events

### Features
- **Immutable event storage** with SHA-256 integrity hashing
- **Complete evidence chains** from source to final output
- **Verification status tracking** with quality metrics
- **Export capabilities** for external audit review
- **Real-time integrity validation**

**Location**: `src/a3e/core/audit_trail.py`

## Integration and Service Layer

### Proprietary A³E Service
The main service class (`src/a3e/services/proprietary_a3e_service.py`) integrates all four proprietary capabilities:

- **Complete pipeline orchestration** with full traceability
- **Evidence processing** with proprietary embeddings
- **Ontology concept mapping** and domain classification
- **Quality scoring** and validation
- **Strategic recommendations** based on analysis
- **Comprehensive reporting** with audit trails

### API Endpoints
New proprietary API routes (`src/a3e/api/routes/proprietary.py`):

- `POST /api/v1/proprietary/analyze/complete` - Complete accreditation analysis
- `POST /api/v1/proprietary/analyze/evidence` - Single evidence analysis
- `GET /api/v1/proprietary/ontology/insights` - Ontology exploration
- `POST /api/v1/proprietary/ontology/query` - Concept queries
- `GET /api/v1/proprietary/traceability/{session_id}` - Audit reports
- `POST /api/v1/proprietary/traceability/trace` - Output tracing
- `GET /api/v1/proprietary/capabilities` - Feature overview

## Competitive Advantages

1. **Only system with domain-specific accreditation ontology** - No competitors have this level of accreditation intelligence
2. **Multi-dimensional embedding schema** optimized specifically for higher education contexts
3. **Proprietary vector-weighted matching** algorithm with multi-factor scoring
4. **Specialized four-agent pipeline** with role-based LLM expertise
5. **Complete audit traceability** system for regulatory compliance
6. **Institution-type contextualization** for different educational settings
7. **Multi-accreditor support** with unified analysis framework

## Usage Examples

### Complete Analysis
```python
from a3e.services.proprietary_a3e_service import ProprietaryA3EService

# Initialize service
service = ProprietaryA3EService(llm_service, embedding_model, audit_db_path)

# Run complete analysis
results = await service.process_accreditation_analysis(
    institution_id="university_abc",
    accreditor_id="sacscoc",
    evidence_documents=evidence_docs,
    standards_scope=standards_list
)

# Results include:
# - Complete pipeline analysis
# - Gap identification with severity
# - Professional narratives  
# - Verified citations
# - Full audit trail
```

### Single Evidence Analysis
```python
# Analyze individual evidence
analysis = await service.analyze_single_evidence(
    evidence_content="Faculty handbook content...",
    evidence_title="Faculty Handbook 2024",
    evidence_type="policy_document",
    standards_to_check=["faculty_qualifications", "faculty_development"]
)

# Returns ontology mapping, confidence scores, and recommendations
```

### Ontology Exploration
```python
# Get ontology insights
insights = await service.get_ontology_insights()

# Explore specific concepts
concept_details = ontology.nodes["faculty_qualifications"]
hierarchy = ontology.get_concept_hierarchy("faculty_qualifications")
related = ontology.find_related_concepts("faculty_qualifications")
```

### Audit Traceability
```python
# Generate audit report
audit_report = service.audit_system.generate_audit_report(session_id)

# Trace output to sources
trace_results = service.audit_system.trace_output_to_sources(output_id)

# Export for external review
audit_data = service.audit_system.export_audit_data(session_id, format="json")
```

These proprietary capabilities position A³E as the most advanced and comprehensive accreditation intelligence platform available, with unique features that provide significant competitive advantages in accuracy, compliance, and audit readiness.
