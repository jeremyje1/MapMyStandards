# 00 – What problem are we solving?

Accreditation prep is still manual. Surveys (AACSB 2024) show IR teams spending 55 % of time just locating evidence for standards.  
A³E turns that drudgery into a nightly cron job:

1. **Ingest** anything (PDF, CSV, SQL dump, Canvas API).  
2. **Map** artefacts to standards using a domain ontology + embeddings.  
3. **Narrate**: agents draft self‑study prose with live citations.  
4. **Dashboard** gaps and risk areas for humans to review.
