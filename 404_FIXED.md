# ✅ **404 ERROR FIXED!**

## 🎯 **PROBLEM RESOLVED**

The 404 "Not Found" error has been **completely fixed**!

### **🔍 What Was Wrong:**
- The `/api/v1/integrations/` endpoint was listed in the main page but didn't actually exist
- The integrations router had specific endpoints (`/status`, `/canvas/test`, etc.) but no root endpoint

### **✅ What Was Fixed:**
- ✅ Added missing root endpoint: `GET /api/v1/integrations/`
- ✅ Provides comprehensive overview of all available integrations
- ✅ Lists all endpoints and their current status
- ✅ Server restarted with fixes applied
