- ✅ Email testing scripts created and verified

## ⚠️ CURRENT ISSUES TO RESOLVE

### 💳 Stripe Configuration
**Issue:** Expired Live API Keys
```
Error: "Expired API Key provided: sk_live_***...***koeGrR"
```

**Solution Required:**
1. Update Railway environment variables with valid Stripe keys
2. Either use fresh live keys or switch to test mode for testing

### 📧 MailerSend SMTP Credentials
**Issue:** Missing SMTP credentials in local environment
```
SMTP_USERNAME and SMTP_PASSWORD not configured locally
```

**Solution Required:**
1. Add MailerSend SMTP credentials to .env file (see MAILERSEND_ENV_EXAMPLE.txt)
2. Or configure environment variables in production

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. Fix Stripe Integration (Priority 1)
```bash
# In Railway dashboard, update environment variables:
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... (or valid live key)
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_... (or valid live key)
```

### 2. Complete Customer Flow Test
Once Stripe is fixed, run:
```bash
python3 test_actual_production_api.py
```

### 3. Add MailerSend Credentials (Optional for local testing)
Create `.env` file with:
```
SMTP_USERNAME=your_mailersend_username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_mailersend_password
FROM_EMAIL=hello@mapmystandards.ai
```
