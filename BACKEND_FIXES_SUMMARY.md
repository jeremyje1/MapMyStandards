# Backend Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Documents API Routes Not Registered (404 Errors)
**Problem**: The `/api/documents/*` endpoints were returning 404 because the router wasn't being registered in `main.py`

**Fix**: Added router registration in `main.py`:
```python
# Conditionally register documents_enhanced router
if 'documents_enhanced_router_available' in globals() and documents_enhanced_router_available:
    app.include_router(documents_enhanced_router)
    logger.info("✅ Documents enhanced router loaded (/api/documents)")
```

### 2. Authentication Async Context Manager Error (500 Errors)
**Problem**: Login endpoint was throwing `RuntimeError: generator didn't stop after athrow()` due to raising HTTPException inside an async context manager

**Fix**: Modified `auth_session.py` to handle errors outside the context manager:
```python
auth_failed = False
async with _maybe_session() as session:
    # ... check authentication ...
    if not valid:
        auth_failed = True
        
if auth_failed:
    raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid credentials")
```

### 3. AWS Bedrock Model ID Validation Error
**Problem**: LLM health checks failing with "The provided model identifier is invalid"

**Fix**: Updated model ID in `config.py` to use the correct version format:
```python
bedrock_model_id: str = Field(default="anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0", env="BEDROCK_MODEL_ID")
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Documents API endpoints are now accessible (returning 401/403 for auth instead of 404)
- ✅ Authentication errors fixed (now properly returning 401 instead of 500)
- ✅ Backend is stable and running
- ⚠️ AWS Bedrock may still need region-specific configuration

## Testing
Created `test-upload.html` to verify the upload functionality:
1. Login with test credentials
2. Upload files via drag-and-drop or file selection
3. List uploaded files
4. Download files

## Next Steps
1. Test with real user credentials
2. Verify S3 bucket permissions are configured
3. Monitor for any remaining AWS Bedrock issues
4. Update the production upload pages to use the working endpoints
