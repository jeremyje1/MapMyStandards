# Authentication Flow Fix - Complete

## Issue
After users complete the signup → checkout → password → onboarding flow, they were redirected to `/dashboard` which then redirected to `/ai-dashboard`, but were seeing "You're not signed in" message and being asked to sign in again.

## Root Cause
1. The onboarding completion was redirecting to `/dashboard` instead of `/dashboard-modern`
2. The dashboard-modern.html was making API calls without including the authentication token in the headers, resulting in 401 errors

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Redirect Path (onboarding.html)
- Changed redirect from `https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/dashboard` to `https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/dashboard-modern`
- Updated both the automatic redirect after completion and the skip button redirect

### 2. Added Authentication Headers to All API Calls (dashboard-modern.html)
- Updated `loadMetrics()` method to include Authorization header with Bearer token
- Updated `checkDisplayMode()` function to include authentication headers
- Updated `ensureTimeseries()` method to include authentication headers
- Updated evidence upload API calls to include authentication headers
- Updated document upload fallback API call to include authentication headers

### 3. Authentication Token Priority
The system checks for tokens in this order:
1. `a3e_api_key` from localStorage
2. `a3e_api_key` from sessionStorage
3. `token` from localStorage
4. `access_token` from localStorage
5. `jwt_token` from localStorage

## Result
Users should now be able to complete the entire flow without being asked to sign in again:
- Signup → Checkout → Set Password → Onboarding → Dashboard (authenticated)

The dashboard will properly authenticate API requests and display the personalized dashboard content instead of the "You're not signed in" message.

## Testing Recommendations
1. Clear browser cache/localStorage
2. Go through complete signup flow
3. Verify smooth transition from onboarding to dashboard
4. Check that dashboard loads with user data (metrics, recent activity, etc.)
5. Verify no 401 errors in browser console
