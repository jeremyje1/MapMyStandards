# ✅ Trial Signup Flow Fix - RESOLVED

## Issue
Users were getting stuck at `https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/trial-signup-flow.html` when trying to start their trial.

## Root Cause
The homepage was redirecting to `trial-signup-flow.html` which:
1. Wasn't properly deployed to the frontend
2. Had incorrect API endpoints
3. Was overly complex compared to the working React register component

## Solution Implemented ✅

### 1. Homepage Redirect Update
- **Changed**: Homepage JavaScript now redirects to `/register` instead of `/trial-signup-flow.html`
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `web/homepage.html`
  - `web/index.html`
- **New Flow**: Homepage → `https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/register?email=...&plan=...`

### 2. React Register Component Enhancement
- **Enhanced**: Register component now reads URL parameters
- **Pre-fills**: Email and institution name from URL
- **File Updated**: `frontend/src/components/auth/Register.tsx`
- **Benefits**: Uses working authentication system

### 3. Fallback Option
- **Added**: `trial-signup-flow.html` to `frontend/public/` as backup
- **Fixed**: API endpoints to use correct backend URLs
- **Status**: Available if needed at `/trial-signup-flow.html`

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Homepage Trial Signup
```
1. Visit: https://api.mapmystandards.ai
2. Click "Start Free Trial" button
3. Enter email address
4. Should redirect to: https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/register?email=...
5. Register form should be pre-filled with email
```

### 2. Direct Register Access
```
1. Visit: https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/register
2. Should see clean React registration form
3. Form submits to working /auth/register endpoint
```

## Verification ✅

- ✅ Homepage redirects to `/register` instead of trial-signup-flow.html
- ✅ Register component pre-fills email from URL parameters
- ✅ Registration uses working backend authentication system
- ✅ Deployed to both backend (API) and frontend (platform)
- ✅ No more getting stuck on trial-signup-flow.html

## Status: RESOLVED

**Next Steps for Users:**
1. Visit https://api.mapmystandards.ai
2. Click "Start Free Trial"
3. Complete registration on the working React form
4. Get redirected to dashboard after successful signup

The trial signup flow now uses the proven React authentication system instead of the problematic standalone HTML page.
