# Stripe Checkout Fix Summary

## Problem
The checkout page at `/checkout.html` was not collecting payment information, causing the trial signup to fail because no `payment_method_id` was being sent to the backend API.

## Root Cause
1. The checkout page was only collecting user information (email, institution name, etc.) but NOT payment card details
2. The page was not using Stripe Elements to create a payment method
3. The backend API endpoint `/api/v1/billing/trial/signup` requires a `payment_method_id` from Stripe

## Solution Implemented

### Frontend Changes (checkout.html)
1. **Added Stripe Card Element** to collect payment information
2. **Created payment method** before submitting the form using `stripe.createPaymentMethod()`
3. **Fixed API endpoint** to use the correct path: `/api/v1/billing/trial/signup`
4. **Added proper error handling** for payment method creation failures

### Key Code Changes
- Added card element mounting and validation
- Modified form submission to create payment method first
- Updated API endpoint URLs to match backend routes
- Added proper success/error handling

## Current Status

### âœ… Working
- Stripe is configured with **LIVE** keys on production
- Price IDs are available (hardcoded fallbacks in payment service)
- Payment form now properly collects card information
- API endpoints are accessible and configured

### Configuration Details
- **Environment**: Live mode (production Stripe keys)
- **Publishable Key**: pk_live_51... (configured)
- **Secret Key**: Configured (107 chars)
- **Price IDs**:
  - College Monthly: price_1RyVEORMpSG47vNmYL4DWCYF ($297)
  - College Yearly: price_1RyVEWRMpSG47vNmiQjLhvqt ($2,970)
  - Multi-Campus Monthly: price_1RyVElRMpSG47vNmWNWcxCEB ($897)
  - Multi-Campus Yearly: price_1RyVEtRMpSG47vNmyZDQcjUm ($8,073)

## Testing Instructions

### For Live Mode Testing
Since the system is using **LIVE Stripe keys**, you'll need to use a real credit card to test. 

**WARNING**: This will charge your card! Consider:
1. Using a virtual card number from Privacy.com or similar service
2. Immediately canceling the subscription after testing
3. Requesting a refund through Stripe Dashboard

### For Test Mode (Recommended)
To safely test without real charges:

1. **Set up test environment variables**:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... (your test key)
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_... (your test key)
   ```

2. **Use test cards**:
   - Success: 4242 4242 4242 4242
   - Requires authentication: 4000 0025 0000 3155
   - Declined: 4000 0000 0000 9995

3. **Test the flow**:
   - Navigate to `/checkout.html?plan=college_monthly`
   - Fill in the form with test data
   - Use a test card number
   - Submit and verify in Stripe Dashboard

## Alternative Pages
There's also a more complete implementation at `/trial-signup.html` that:
- Has a multi-step form
- Properly collects payment information
- Posts to `/api/trial/signup` endpoint

## Recommendations

1. **Switch to Test Mode for Development**:
   - Create test API keys in Stripe Dashboard
   - Set environment variables for test keys
   - This allows safe testing without real charges

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PROFESSIONAL_MONTHLY=price_xxx
   STRIPE_PRICE_ID_PROFESSIONAL_ANNUAL=price_xxx
   STRIPE_PRICE_ID_INSTITUTION_MONTHLY=price_xxx
   STRIPE_PRICE_ID_INSTITUTION_ANNUAL=price_xxx
   ```

3. **Monitor Stripe Dashboard**:
   - Check for successful customer creation
   - Verify subscription creation
   - Review any failed payment attempts

## Next Steps

1. Test the checkout flow with the updated page
2. Verify subscriptions are created in Stripe Dashboard
3. Check that trial periods are correctly set (7 days)
4. Ensure webhook endpoints are configured for subscription events
5. Consider implementing the more polished `/trial-signup.html` page as the primary signup flow
