# User Data Integration Complete âœ…

## Overview
The platform now fully utilizes the user's institutional data stored in the Railway database to provide a personalized and context-aware experience.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. User Profile Endpoint
- **Added**: `/api/user/intelligence-simple/user/profile` endpoint
- **Purpose**: Retrieves complete user data from the database including:
  - Institution name (Houston City College)
  - Primary accreditor (SACSCOC)
  - Role (President)
  - Onboarding data
  - Usage metrics (documents analyzed, reports generated, etc.)

### 2. Dashboard Personalization
- **Welcome Message**: Now shows "Welcome back, Houston City College! ðŸ‘‹"
- **Subtitle**: "Let's continue your SACSCOC accreditation journey"
- **Journey Tracker**: Automatically updates based on actual usage data
- **Standards Link**: Pre-selects SACSCOC accreditor when navigating to standards page

### 3. Upload Page Enhancements
- **Institution Badge**: Shows "Houston City College â€¢ SACSCOC" in header
- **Contextual Uploads**: All files uploaded now include:
  - Institution name
  - Primary accreditor
  - Institution type (college)
  - This context is stored with each file for better AI analysis

### 4. AI Analysis Improvements
- **Document Processing**: When analyzing documents, the system now:
  - Knows the user is from Houston City College
  - Focuses on SACSCOC standards
  - Applies institutional context for more relevant mappings
  - Includes metadata in evidence documents for better matching

### 5. Evidence Library Fix
- Fixed JavaScript errors
- Documents now load properly
- User profile data is used instead of broken endpoint

## Benefits

1. **More Relevant Results**: AI analysis now considers your specific institution and accreditor
2. **Faster Workflow**: No need to repeatedly select SACSCOC - it's remembered
3. **Personalized Experience**: The platform adapts to your institution's needs
4. **Better Tracking**: Your actual progress is reflected in metrics and journey tracker
5. **Contextual Intelligence**: All AI features now understand your institutional context

## Testing the Integration

1. **Clear browser cache** (important for latest changes)
2. **Log in** at https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/login-enhanced-v2.html
3. **Check Dashboard**: Should show "Welcome back, Houston City College!"
4. **Upload a Document**: Should see institution badge in header
5. **Browse Standards**: Should default to SACSCOC standards
6. **Evidence Library**: Should work without errors

## Technical Details

- User data is fetched from PostgreSQL database on Railway
- Institutional context is applied to all uploads and AI operations
- Data is cached in localStorage for performance
- Fallback mechanisms ensure the app works even if database is unavailable

## Next Steps

The platform will now:
- Automatically focus on SACSCOC requirements
- Provide Houston City College-specific recommendations
- Track your institution's progress accurately
- Generate reports tailored to your accreditor's format

Your institutional data is now fully integrated into every aspect of the platform! ðŸŽ‰
