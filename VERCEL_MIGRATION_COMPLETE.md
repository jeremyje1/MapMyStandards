# Frontend Migration to Vercel - Complete! âœ…

## Migration Summary

Your frontend has been successfully migrated from Railway to Vercel, which will eliminate the recurring deployment confusion.

## Current Setup

**Backend (API):** Railway - `api.mapmystandards.ai`
- Project: `prolific-fulfillment` (4f3575e8-ba3c-4cbb-a566-2dc318c6f58c)
- Service: MapMyStandards
- Status: âœ… Deployed and building

**Frontend (App):** Vercel - `app.mapmystandards.ai`
- Project: `map-my-standards`
- Status: âœ… Deployed successfully
- Current URL: https://map-my-standards-liofn0pqa-jeremys-projects-73929cad.vercel.app

## What's Working

1. âœ… Frontend builds and deploys on Vercel
2. âœ… Custom domain `app.mapmystandards.ai` added to Vercel
3. âœ… Automatic deployments from GitHub pushes
4. âœ… React build configuration optimized for Vercel

## Final Steps Needed

### 1. DNS Configuration
Set this A record with your DNS provider (e.g., Cloudflare):
```
A app.mapmystandards.ai 76.76.21.21
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Add these in the Vercel dashboard (Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables):
- `REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` = (your Stripe publishable key)
- Any other sensitive variables

### 3. SSL Certificate
Vercel will automatically provision SSL once DNS is configured.

## Deployment Commands

**Backend (Railway):**
```bash
cd /path/to/MapMyStandards-main
railway link  # Select: prolific-fulfillment â†’ production â†’ MapMyStandards
railway up --detach
```

**Frontend (Vercel):**
```bash
cd /path/to/MapMyStandards-main/frontend
vercel --prod
```

## Benefits of This Setup

- **No more confusion** between frontend/backend projects
- **Vercel optimized for React** - faster builds and deployments
- **Automatic deployments** from GitHub
- **Better error handling** and logs in Vercel dashboard
- **Edge caching** and CDN for better performance

## Next Deployment

From now on:
1. **Backend changes**: Deploy via Railway CLI or Railway dashboard
2. **Frontend changes**: Automatically deploy when you push to GitHub, or use `vercel --prod`

Your deployment architecture is now clean and professional! ðŸš€
