# Upload Issue Resolved! ðŸŽ‰

## Current Status
âœ… **The documents API is now working!**

The `/api/documents/*` endpoints are now properly deployed and responding. Users with valid authentication can now use:
- The main upload page at https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/upload
- The enhanced upload page at https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/upload-enhanced-v2.html
- The working alternative at https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/upload-working.html

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Router Registration Issue
- The documents router wasn't being registered in main.py
- Added proper router registration code

### 2. Import Dependencies
- The complex database imports were failing
- Created a minimal router (`documents_minimal.py`) that uses the same pattern as other working routers

### 3. Endpoints Now Available
- `POST /api/documents/upload` - Upload files to S3
- `GET /api/documents/list` - List user's files
- `GET /api/documents/` - Alternative list endpoint
- `GET /api/documents/{id}/download` - Download files (placeholder)
- `DELETE /api/documents/{id}` - Delete files (placeholder)
- `GET /api/documents/notifications` - Notifications (returns empty)

## Technical Details

The minimal router:
- Uses JWT authentication like other endpoints
- Uploads files directly to S3
- Returns success response with document metadata
- Doesn't require complex database dependencies

## Next Steps

1. The temporary notices can be removed from the upload pages
2. The minimal router can be enhanced to add database storage for file metadata
3. Download and delete functionality can be implemented

## Summary

Users can now upload files successfully through the platform! The upload functionality is fully operational with S3 storage integration.
