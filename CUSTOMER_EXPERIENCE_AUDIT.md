# Customer Experience Audit Report - MapMyStandards A¬≥E Platform

## Executive Summary

This audit identifies critical issues with the customer experience on the MapMyStandards platform. Multiple broken links, API endpoint mismatches, and unclear navigation paths are preventing customers from accessing the services they're paying for.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **Broken Navigation Links** üö®
The main navigation contains multiple broken links pointing to non-existent locations:

- Login attempts to reach `https://api.mapmystandards.ai/auth/login` - should be `https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/auth/login`
- Password reset uses `https://api.mapmystandards.ai/auth/password-reset` - wrong subdomain
