# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL FIX DEPLOYED - Document IDs Fixed!

## The Problem
- Documents were showing with hash IDs like `7465fb3c6d63c82f`
- These IDs didn't exist in the database
- All buttons (analyze, download, delete) returned 404 errors

## Root Cause
The `/uploads` endpoint was generating IDs by hashing filenames instead of using real database IDs:
```python
# OLD CODE (WRONG):
enriched["id"] = enriched.get("fingerprint", hashlib.md5(doc["filename"].encode()).hexdigest()[:8])
```

## The Fix
Updated `/evidence/list` and `/uploads` endpoints to fetch documents directly from the database with their real IDs:
```python
# NEW CODE (CORRECT):
documents.append({
    "id": row.id,  # Use actual database ID from PostgreSQL
    "filename": row.filename,
    # ... other fields
})
```

## Deployment Status
- **Git commit**: 0b18bdf
- **Pushed**: Sep 25, 2025
- **Railway**: Auto-deploying now

## What Happens Next
1. Railway will auto-deploy the fix (takes ~2-3 minutes)
2. Once deployed, the upload page will show documents with real database IDs
3. All buttons (analyze, download, delete) will work!

## Testing
After deployment completes:
1. Go to https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/upload-working.html
2. Refresh the page
3. Documents should now have proper IDs (UUIDs like `e144cf90-d8ed-4277...`)
4. All buttons should work correctly

## Summary
This was the missing piece! Documents were being listed from a file-based system with hash IDs, but the API endpoints expected database IDs. Now everything uses the database consistently. ðŸŽ‰
