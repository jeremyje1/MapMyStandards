# Report Generation Fix Deployed

## Issue Fixed
The report-generation.html page was showing static hardcoded values (87% coverage, 73 standards) for every document upload.

## Solution Implemented
1. Added `updateWithRealMetrics()` function to report-generation.html that:
   - Fetches the user's latest upload data
   - Fetches dashboard metrics from the API
   - Updates the DOM elements with real values

2. Modified the success state display to call this function before showing the report

## Changes Made
- File: `web/report-generation.html`
- Added async function to fetch real data from:
  - `/api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads` - for latest compliance score
  - `/api/user/intelligence-simple/dashboard-metrics` - for total metrics
- Updates these elements dynamically:
  - Overall Coverage percentage
  - Standards Mapped count
  - Documents Analyzed count
  - Gaps Identified count

## How It Works Now
1. User uploads a document
2. After analysis completes, they're redirected to /report-generation
3. The page loads with hardcoded values initially
4. JavaScript runs `updateWithRealMetrics()` to fetch real data
5. DOM is updated with actual values from the user's analysis

## Testing Instructions
1. Upload a document through the platform
2. Wait for analysis to complete
3. When you see the "Report Generated Successfully" page
4. The metrics should show real values, not the static 87%/73

## Backend Deployment Status
The fix is deployed to the backend at https://a3e-main.railway.app

## Note
The page will gracefully fall back to hardcoded values if the API calls fail, ensuring the user always sees something.
