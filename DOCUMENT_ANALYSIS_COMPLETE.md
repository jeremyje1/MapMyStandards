# Document Analysis & User Context Integration Complete âœ…

## Overview
The platform now properly handles document analysis and user context for ALL users, not just hardcoded data.

## Major Improvements

### 1. User Profile Endpoint (`/api/user/intelligence-simple/user/profile`)
- Fetches complete user data from PostgreSQL database
- Returns institution name, primary accreditor, role, and usage metrics
- Works for ANY authenticated user
- Fallback to JWT data if user not in database

### 2. Document Analysis Enhancements

#### New Endpoints:
- **POST** `/api/user/intelligence-simple/documents/{document_id}/analyze`
  - Analyzes documents already uploaded
  - Stores analysis results in database
  - Caches results for faster retrieval

#### Automatic Analysis:
- Documents are now automatically analyzed upon upload
- Supported formats: PDF, TXT, DOC, DOCX
- Analysis includes:
  - Text extraction (with OCR fallback for PDFs)
  - PII redaction (emails, SSNs, phone numbers)
  - Standards mapping based on user's accreditor
  - Confidence scoring

### 3. User Context Integration

#### During Upload:
- User's institution name automatically attached to uploads
- Primary accreditor included in file metadata
- Institution type recorded for context

#### During Analysis:
- AI knows which institution uploaded the document
- Focuses on the user's specific accreditor standards
- Provides institution-specific recommendations

### 4. Frontend Improvements

#### Dashboard:
- Shows personalized welcome: "Welcome back, [Institution Name]!"
- Displays accreditation journey for user's specific accreditor
- Pre-selects user's accreditor when navigating to standards

#### Upload Page:
- Shows institution badge in header
- Download button for all documents
- "Analyze" button for unanalyzed documents
- Status indicator showing analyzed vs unanalyzed files

#### Evidence Library:
- Fixed JavaScript errors
- Documents load from correct endpoint
- User context applied to all operations

### 5. Database Schema Fix

Created `fix_documents_table_schema.sql` to add missing columns:
- file_key, user_id, organization_id
- file_size, content_type, sha256
- status, uploaded_at, deleted_at
- evidence_mappings table for storing analysis results
