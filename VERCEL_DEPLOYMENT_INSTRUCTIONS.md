# Vercel Frontend Deployment Instructions

## Issue
The Vercel deployment is blocked because the git authors (jeremy.estrella@mapmystandards.ai and jeremy.estrella@sait.ca) don't have access to the "Jeremy's projects" team on Vercel.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Add Team Access (Recommended)
1. Go to https://vercel.com/teams/jeremys-projects-73929cad/settings/members
2. Add both emails as team members:
   - jeremy.estrella@mapmystandards.ai
   - jeremy.estrella@sait.ca
3. Once added, run:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/jeremys-projects-73929cad/map-my-standards
2. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"
3. The dashboard will pull from your GitHub repository

### Option 3: Use GitHub Integration
1. Push changes to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
2. Vercel should automatically deploy if GitHub integration is set up

### Option 4: Create Personal Deployment
1. Login to Vercel with a personal account that has access
2. Import the project:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   vercel
   ```
3. Select "N" when asked about linking to existing project
4. Create a new project under your personal account

## What Was Changed

The frontend has been updated with:

1. **Real-time Dashboard Metrics**
   - Shows actual compliance score from backend
   - Displays standards mapped count (e.g., "5 / 87")
   - No more hardcoded 91% or 5/3 values

2. **New API Integration**
   - Added `dashboardMetrics()` method to fetch real data
   - Fixed TypeScript type issues

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Added Standards Mapped card with proper display
   - Dashboard now fetches metrics dynamically

## Build Status
âœ… The frontend builds successfully:
- Build completed without errors
- Only minor TypeScript warning (fixed)
- Ready for production deployment

## Files Changed
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx`
- `frontend/src/services/api.ts`

## After Deployment
Once deployed, verify:
1. Dashboard shows real metrics (not 91% or 5/3)
2. Standards Mapped displays as "X / Y" format
3. All metrics update when new documents are uploaded
