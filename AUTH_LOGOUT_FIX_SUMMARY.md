# Authentication Logout Fix Summary üîê

## Problem
When users clicked "Upload Documents" from the dashboard, they were being logged out instead of navigating to the upload page.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing Export**: The `checkAuth` function was defined but not exported in `window.commonUtils`
2. **URL Mismatch**: The `checkAuth` function was checking for pages with `.html` extension, but Vercel serves without extensions
3. **Inconsistent Navigation**: Navigation links had mixed formats (some with `/`, some with `.html`)
4. **SSO Provider 404**: The login page tries to fetch `/api/sso/providers` which doesn't exist (but this is harmless)

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed commonUtils Export (common.js)
```javascript
// Added checkAuth to exports
window.commonUtils = {
    showLoading,
    hideLoading,
    showAlert,
    apiRequest,
    formatDate,
    formatFileSize,
    debounce,
    createProgressBar,
    updateProgressBar,
    logout,
    checkAuth  // ‚Üê Added this
};
```

### 2. Fixed checkAuth Function (common.js)
```javascript
// Updated to handle URLs without .html extensions
const publicPages = ['login-enhanced-v2.html', 'login-enhanced.html', 'homepage-enhanced.html', 'forgot-password.html', 
                    'login-enhanced-v2', 'login-enhanced', 'homepage-enhanced', 'forgot-password', '', 'index.html'];

// Fixed redirect to use path without .html
if (!token && !publicPages.includes(currentPage)) {
    window.location.href = '/login-enhanced-v2';
}
```

### 3. Fixed Navigation Links (upload-enhanced-v2.html)
```html
<!-- Changed from mixed formats to consistent paths -->
<div class="nav-links">
    <a href="/dashboard-enhanced">Dashboard</a>
    <a href="/upload-enhanced-v2" class="active">Upload</a>
    <a href="/standards-graph-enhanced">Standards</a>
    <a href="/reports-enhanced">Reports</a>
    <a href="/settings-enhanced">Settings</a>
</div>
```

### 4. Fixed Logout Redirect (common.js)
```javascript
// Changed to use path without .html
window.location.href = '/login-enhanced-v2';
```

## Result
‚úÖ Users can now navigate to the upload page without being logged out
‚úÖ Authentication persists across page navigation
‚úÖ URLs are consistent across the platform

## About the SSO Provider 404
The error `api.mapmystandards.ai/api/sso/providers:1 Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404` is harmless. This endpoint doesn't exist yet but the login page gracefully handles the 404 response.

## Testing
1. Log in at https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/login-enhanced-v2
2. Navigate to Dashboard
3. Click "Upload Documents" 
4. You should now see the upload page without being logged out

## Deployment Status
‚úÖ All fixes deployed to production via Vercel
