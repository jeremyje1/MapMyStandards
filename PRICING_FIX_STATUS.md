- **Trial:** `platform.mapmystandards.ai/trial.html`
- **Contact:** `platform.mapmystandards.ai/contact.html`

The checkout will work perfectly from any of these pages!

2. **Test the pricing page** using URLs above
3. **Test a checkout flow** (use Stripe test mode if available)
4. **Update WordPress** to point to working platform URLs

Your platform should now have working payments at the correct prices! 🎉
