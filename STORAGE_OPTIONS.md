# Storage Options for MapMyStandards (No AWS Required)

## Current Situation
Railway's ephemeral filesystem means local storage isn't sustainable. Files would be lost on redeploys.

## Recommended Free/Low-Cost Alternatives

### Option 1: **Cloudinary** (Recommended for Quick Setup)
- **Free Tier**: 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month
- **Pros**: No credit card required, built-in CDN, image/PDF transformations
- **Setup Time**: 5 minutes

```bash
# Railway environment variables
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret
```

### Option 2: **Supabase Storage** (Best for Full Integration)
- **Free Tier**: 1GB storage, 2GB bandwidth
- **Pros**: Already using Postgres? Perfect integration
- **Setup Time**: 10 minutes

```bash
# Railway environment variables  
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-key
```

### Option 3: **Uploadthing** (Easiest Setup)
- **Free Tier**: 2GB storage
- **Pros**: Designed for Next.js, minimal config
- **Setup Time**: 5 minutes

```bash
# Railway environment variables
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=your-secret
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=your-app-id
```

### Option 4: **Backblaze B2** (Most Cost-Effective)
- **Free Tier**: 10GB storage, 1GB/day bandwidth
- **Pros**: S3-compatible API, very cheap after free tier
- **Cost**: $0.005/GB/month (way cheaper than AWS)

```bash
# Railway environment variables (S3-compatible)
B2_KEY_ID=your-key-id
B2_APPLICATION_KEY=your-app-key
B2_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket
B2_ENDPOINT=https://s3.us-west-002.backblazeb2.com
```

### Option 5: **Railway Volumes** (Persistent Storage)
- **Cost**: $0.25/GB/month
- **Pros**: Native Railway integration, truly persistent
- **Setup**: Add volume in Railway dashboard

```yaml
# railway.toml
[mounts]
"/uploads" = "uploads"
```

## Quick Decision Guide

**Choose Cloudinary if:**
- You want it working in 5 minutes
- You need PDF processing/thumbnails
- 25GB is enough for now

**Choose Supabase if:**
- You want a complete backend solution
- You need real-time features later
- You like PostgreSQL integration

**Choose Backblaze B2 if:**
- You expect lots of files (>25GB)
- Cost is critical
- You're comfortable with S3 APIs

**Choose Railway Volumes if:**
- You want to keep everything on Railway
- You're OK with $0.25/GB/month
- You need guaranteed persistence

## Implementation Priority

1. **Immediate**: Use Cloudinary (free, no credit card)
2. **Next Week**: Evaluate Supabase if you need more features
3. **At Scale**: Move to Backblaze B2 for cost optimization

## Next Steps
