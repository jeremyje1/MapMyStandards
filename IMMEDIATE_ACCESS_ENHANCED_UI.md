# 🚀 Immediate Access to Enhanced UI - Working Links

## The Issue
The platform has existing HTML files (dashboard.html, upload.html, etc.) that are being served by Vercel's static hosting, which takes precedence over our routing configuration. However, all enhanced pages are fully deployed and accessible!

## 🔧 To Make Enhanced UI the Default

The enhanced UI is fully functional but requires one of these approaches to make it the default:

1. **Rename Files** (Quick Fix):
   - Rename existing dashboard.html → dashboard-old.html
   - Rename dashboard-enhanced.html → dashboard.html
   - Same for other pages

2. **Update Vercel Routes** (Better):
   - Remove/rename existing HTML files
   - Let rewrites handle routing

3. **Backend Override** (Currently Active):
   - The API backend (Railway) already serves enhanced pages
   - Access via: https://api.mapmystandards.ai/dashboard
