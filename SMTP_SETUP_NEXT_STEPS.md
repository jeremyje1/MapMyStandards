# Email Working but SMTP Still Needs Setup

## Current Status
✅ **Email account exists and working in webmail**
❌ **SMTP authentication still failing**

## Next Steps to Enable SMTP

### Option 1: Check SMTP Settings in Titan Webmail
1. **Login to your Titan webmail** (from the screenshot you shared)
2. Look for **Settings** or **Account Settings**
3. Find **SMTP/Mail Client Settings** or **App Passwords**
4. Check if there's an option to:
   - Enable SMTP access
   - Generate an app-specific password
   - Enable "Less secure app access"

### Option 2: Namecheap Email Settings
1. **Go to Namecheap** → Domain List → Manage → Advanced DNS
2. Look for **Email Settings** or **Professional Email**
3. Check for SMTP configuration options
4. Verify the account is set up for SMTP sending

### Option 3: Try Alternative SMTP Settings
Sometimes providers use different settings:

```env
# Try this in your .env file:
SMTP_SERVER=mail.mapmystandards.ai
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USE_TLS=true
SMTP_USERNAME=support@mapmystandards.ai
SMTP_PASSWORD=Ipo4Eva45*
```

Or try:
```env
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.mapmystandards.ai
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USE_TLS=true
SMTP_USERNAME=support@mapmystandards.ai
SMTP_PASSWORD=Ipo4Eva45*
```

### Option 4: Contact Namecheap Support
Ask them specifically:
- "How do I configure SMTP settings for my Titan Email account?"
- "What are the correct SMTP server settings for mapmystandards.ai?"
- "Do I need to enable SMTP access or create an app password?"

## Test Instructions
After making changes, test with:
```bash
python final_email_test.py
```

## Temporary Workaround
Since your email account exists and works in webmail, your contact forms can be configured to:
1. Save form submissions to a database
2. Send you notifications via the web interface
3. You can manually check and respond to inquiries

The infrastructure is there - we just need the SMTP configuration details from Namecheap/Titan!
