# Complete Diagnosis Summary

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Authentication Flow (FIXED)
- **Issue**: Users were being asked to sign in again after onboarding
- **Cause**: Dashboard API calls were missing authentication headers
- **Fix**: Updated dashboard-modern.html to include Bearer tokens in all API calls
- **Status**: Working - users can now flow seamlessly through the process

### 2. ✅ User Creation via Stripe Webhook (WORKING)
- **Issue**: Thought users weren't being created
- **Finding**: Webhook IS working correctly - your user was created and updated
- **Evidence**: Logs show "✅ Updated existing user in database: jeremy.estrella@gmail.com"
- **Status**: No fix needed - working as designed

### 3. ❌ Onboarding Data Persistence (ISSUE FOUND)
- **Issue**: "Houston College" entered during onboarding doesn't persist
- **Cause**: Onboarding saves to JSON file, not database
- **Current State**: Your database shows "NorthPath Strategies" (from initial signup)
- **Desired State**: Should show "Houston College" (from onboarding)

## Your Current User Data
```
Email: jeremy.estrella@gmail.com
Name: Jeremy Estrella
Institution: NorthPath Strategies (not Houston College!)
Role: Director
Stripe: ✅ Connected and working
```

## Why This Matters
- Customization uses the database institution_name
- Analysis and reports pull from database
- The JSON file is only used for temporary settings

## Solutions

### Immediate Fix (for you)
Run: `python3 update_user_institution.py --update`
This will change your institution from "NorthPath Strategies" to "Houston College"

### Long-term Fix (code change needed)
The onboarding process needs to update the database, not just save to JSON.

### Backend Change Required
```python
# In user_intelligence_simple.py settings endpoint
# Add database update when institution changes
if 'organization' in payload:
    # Update user record in database
    await update_user_institution(user_id, payload['organization'])
```

## Summary
1. ✅ Authentication is fixed - users can login and stay logged in
2. ✅ User creation works - Stripe webhook creates users properly  
3. ❌ Onboarding doesn't save to database - this is why Houston College isn't persisting
