# Primary Accreditor Field Added ✅

## Overview
The `primary_accreditor` field has been successfully added to the database to store the user's primary accreditation body (e.g., WASC, HLC, MSCHE).

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
- Added `primary_accreditor` column (VARCHAR 255) to users table
- Also added `department` column (VARCHAR 255) for organization structure
- Migration script: `add_primary_accreditor_column.py`

### 2. User Model Update
- Added fields to `src/a3e/models/user.py`:
  - `primary_accreditor = Column(String(255))`
  - `department = Column(String(255))`

### 3. Database Service Update
- `src/a3e/services/user_settings_db.py` already handles these fields:
  - Saves primary_accreditor from settings
  - Saves department from settings
  - Fixed User creation to use correct fields

### 4. API Integration
- The `/api/settings` endpoint automatically saves primary_accreditor to database
- The field is used throughout the API for:
  - Standards graph visualization
  - Evidence analysis
  - Compliance dashboards
  - Report generation

## Testing
Verified with `test_primary_accreditor.py`:
- ✅ Fields are saved to database
- ✅ Fields are loaded from database
- ✅ Data persists across sessions

## How It Works

1. **During Onboarding**: User selects their primary accreditor
2. **Saved to Database**: The selection is stored in the `primary_accreditor` column
3. **Used Throughout**: The API uses this field to filter standards and customize views

## Example Usage
```javascript
// Frontend saves during onboarding
await api.post('/api/settings', {
    primary_accreditor: 'WASC',
    department: 'Academic Affairs',
    // ... other settings
});

// API automatically uses it for standards
const standards = await api.get('/api/standards-graph');
// Returns WASC-specific standards
```

## Production Status
✅ Database migration completed on Railway
✅ Fields are active and working
✅ Ready for production use

The platform will now remember each user's primary accreditor and department, providing a customized experience based on their specific accreditation body.
