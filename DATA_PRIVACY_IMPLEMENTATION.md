## Implementation Date
October 10, 2025

## Key Privacy Principles Implemented

### 1. **No Student-Level Data** üîí
- **Commitment**: MapMyStandards.ai does NOT collect, process, or store personally identifiable student information (PII)
- **Scope**: No student names, IDs, grades, or demographic data
- **Focus**: Institutional or program-level evidence only (syllabi, assessment summaries, policies, reports)

### 2. **Full Institutional Data Ownership** üèõÔ∏è
- **Control**: Institutions retain 100% ownership of all uploaded materials
- **Role**: Platform acts solely as data processor on behalf of the institution
- **Guarantee**: Never share, sell, or disclose institutional materials to third parties
- **Purpose**: Data used only for explicitly requested accreditation-mapping functions

### 3. **Enterprise-Grade Security** üõ°Ô∏è
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication protocols with restricted access
- **Standards**: SOC 2 and GDPR-aligned practices
- **Infrastructure**: Industry-standard security measures throughout

### 4. **Secure Third-Party Integrations** üîå

## Data Controller vs. Processor Clarification
