# API Endpoints Implementation - September 23, 2025

## Summary
Implemented the missing API endpoints identified during platform testing to complete the user journey from login → upload → map → report.

## Implemented Endpoints

### 1. `/api/user/intelligence-simple/evidence/list`
**Method:** GET  
**Purpose:** List all uploaded evidence documents for the current user  
**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "evidence": [
    {
      "id": "fingerprint_hash",
      "filename": "Strategic_Plan_2024.pdf",
      "uploaded_at": "2025-09-23T10:00:00",
      "status": "processed",
      "mapped_count": 3,
      "standards_mapped": ["HLC.1.A", "HLC.2.B", "HLC.3.C"],
      "doc_type": "strategic_plan",
      "size": 2500000
    }
  ],
  "total": 5,
  "unique_standards": ["HLC.1.A", "HLC.2.B", ...]
}
```

### 2. `/api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads`
**Method:** GET  
**Purpose:** Alias for `/evidence/list` to match frontend expectations  
**Response:** Same as `/evidence/list`

### 3. `/api/user/intelligence-simple/standards`
**Method:** GET  
**Purpose:** List standards available to the user based on their primary accreditor  
**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "standards": [
    {
      "id": "HLC.CR.1.A",
      "number": "1.A",
      "description": "The institution's mission is clear...",
      "level": 1,
      "parent_id": null,
      "category": "Core Requirements",
      "accreditor": "HLC"
    }
  ],
  "total": 85,
  "accreditor": "HLC",
  "display_mode": "full"
}
```

### 4. `/api/user/intelligence-simple/metrics/dashboard`
**Method:** GET  
**Purpose:** Alias for `/dashboard/metrics` to match the expected URL pattern  
**Response:** Same as `/dashboard/metrics`

## Implementation Details

### Location
All endpoints were added to: `src/a3e/api/routes/user_intelligence_simple.py`

### Key Features
1. **Evidence List Enhancement:**
   - Adds computed `id` field using fingerprint or filename hash
   - Calculates `status` based on whether standards are mapped
   - Counts mapped standards for quick reference
   - Attempts to get actual file size from saved path

2. **Standards List:**
   - Respects user's primary accreditor from settings
   - Applies display policy (full/redacted) based on user permissions
   - Returns structured standard information with hierarchy

3. **Consistency:**
   - All endpoints follow the existing pattern in the file
   - Use the same authentication mechanism (`get_current_user_simple`)
   - Return consistent JSON response format
   - Handle errors with appropriate HTTP status codes

## Testing
The implementation was validated for syntax correctness using Python's compiler:
```bash
python3 -m py_compile src/a3e/api/routes/user_intelligence_simple.py
```

## Deployment Steps
1. **Commit changes:**
   ```bash
   git add src/a3e/api/routes/user_intelligence_simple.py
   git commit -m "feat: Add missing API endpoints for evidence list, uploads, and standards"
   ```

2. **Push to repository:**
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Deploy to Railway/Production:**
   - The deployment should happen automatically via Railway's GitHub integration
   - Or manually trigger deployment in Railway dashboard

4. **Verify endpoints:**
   ```bash
   # Test evidence list
   curl https://api.mapmystandards.ai/api/user/intelligence-simple/evidence/list \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

   # Test standards list
   curl https://api.mapmystandards.ai/api/user/intelligence-simple/standards \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

## Frontend Integration
The enhanced frontend pages created earlier will now work seamlessly:
- `dashboard-enhanced.html` - Uses `/metrics/dashboard` for metrics
- `upload-enhanced.html` - Uses `/uploads` to show recent uploads
- `standards-selection-wizard.html` - Uses `/standards` for available standards
- `evidence-mapping-wizard.html` - Uses `/evidence/list` for document list

## Next Steps
1. Monitor the endpoints after deployment for any issues
2. Add caching for frequently accessed data like standards
3. Implement pagination for evidence list when users have many documents
4. Add filtering and sorting options to the list endpoints
