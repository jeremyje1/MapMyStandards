# Import Error Fix - Deployment Issue Resolution

## Problem
Deployment was failing with this error:
```
File "/app/src/a3e/main.py", line 24, in <module>
    from .models import Institution, Evidence, Standard, AgentWorkflow, GapAnalysis
```

The Gunicorn workers were crashing on startup due to import issues in the models module.

## Root Cause
The `src/a3e/models/__init__.py` file was using an absolute import:
```python
from a3e.core.accreditation_registry import InstitutionType, AccreditorType
```

This absolute import path doesn't work in the production deployment environment where the module structure is different.

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed Import Path**: Changed to relative import:
   ```python
   from ..core.accreditation_registry import InstitutionType, AccreditorType
   ```

2. **Added Complete Export List**: Added `__all__` list to ensure all models are properly exported:
   ```python
   __all__ = [
       'Base', 'Institution', 'Evidence', 'Standard', 'Accreditor',
       'AgentWorkflow', 'GapAnalysis', 'Narrative', 'AuditLog',
       'ProcessingStatus', 'EvidenceType', 'InstitutionType', 'AccreditorType'
   ]
   ```

## Files Modified
- `src/a3e/models/__init__.py`: Fixed import path and added exports

## Commit
- Commit: `040fbc8` - "Fix models import path - use relative import for accreditation_registry"
- Status: Pushed to GitHub, new deployment triggered

## Expected Result
The FastAPI application should now start successfully in production. All model imports should work correctly, and the landing page should be accessible.

## Next Steps
- Monitor the new deployment for successful startup
- Test the application endpoints once deployed
- Verify that the landing page loads correctly

## Technical Note
This is a common issue when deploying Python applications - absolute imports that work in development don't always work in production containers due to different PYTHONPATH and module resolution behavior.
