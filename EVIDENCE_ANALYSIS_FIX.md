# Evidence Upload & AI Mapping - Fixed

## Issue Resolved
The evidence upload and AI mapping functionality was not working properly - files were stuck in "queued" state with no mapping results or trust scores displayed.

## Root Causes
1. The document processing pipeline was just simulating analysis with a sleep timer
2. No actual evidence-to-standard mapping was being performed
3. No UI to display mapping results
4. No way to manually trigger analysis

## Solution Implemented

### 1. New Evidence Analysis API (`/api/evidence-analysis/*`)
- **POST /upload** - Upload documents with automatic analysis
- **GET /status/{file_id}** - Check analysis progress
- **POST /analyze/{file_id}** - Manually trigger analysis
- **GET /results** - Get all analysis results for user

### 2. Real Evidence Mapping
- Integrated with existing EvidenceMapper service
- Extracts text from PDF, DOC/DOCX, and TXT files
- Maps evidence to standards using:
  - TF-IDF vectorization for candidate retrieval
  - Cross-encoder reranking for accuracy
  - Confidence calibration
  - Rationale extraction

### 3. Enhanced UI Components

#### Dashboard Integration
- Files now show processing status in real-time
- Display trust scores and mapped standards count
- Added "View Analysis" button to open detailed view

#### Dedicated Evidence Analysis Page
- Full-featured upload interface
- Accreditor selection (SACSCOC, HLC, WASC, MSCHE, NECHE, NWCCU)
- Real-time processing status with progress bars
- Detailed mapping results showing:
  - EvidenceTrust Score™ (0-95%)
  - Mapped standards with confidence scores
  - Relevant text excerpts
  - Match explanations

### 4. Features Added
- ✅ Drag-and-drop file upload
- ✅ Multiple file support
- ✅ Real-time status updates
- ✅ Manual analysis trigger
- ✅ Persistent results storage
- ✅ Support for all accrediting bodies
- ✅ Confidence scoring and ranking
- ✅ Relevant text highlighting

## Testing
1. Upload a document through the dashboard
2. Watch status change from "uploading" → "processing" → "analyzed"
3. View trust score and standards count in recent uploads
4. Click "View Analysis" to see detailed mapping results
5. Try different accreditors to see filtered results

## Next Steps
- Add batch processing for multiple documents
- Implement evidence consolidation across documents
- Add export functionality for mapping results
- Integrate with narrative generation (CiteGuard™)
