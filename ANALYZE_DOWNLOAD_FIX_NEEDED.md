# Analyze & Download Issues - Root Cause Identified

## Issue Summary
The analyze and download buttons are failing with:
- **Analyze**: 500 Internal Server Error
- **Download**: 404 Not Found

## Root Cause
The document ID `9cdee4fa-74fd-4cb3-8e9a-ee32c33f3020` exists in the database BUT:
- It belongs to user ID: `e144cf90-d8ed-4277-bf12-3d86443e2099`
- Current user (jeremy.estrella@gmail.com) is trying to access another user's document
- The backend correctly blocks this access for security reasons

## Technical Details

### Database Query Results
```
Document Found:
- ID: 9cdee4fa-74fd-4cb3-8e9a-ee32c33f3020
- Filename: QEP-Final-4.11.24.pdf
- Owner: e144cf90-d8ed-4277-bf12-3d86443e2099 (NOT jeremy)
- Status: uploaded
- Uploaded: 2025-09-25 11:51:51
```

### Why This Happened
1. The frontend is displaying documents from a different user session
2. Possibly cached data from testing with multiple accounts
3. The `/uploads` endpoint correctly filters by user, but cached IDs persist

## Solution

### Immediate Fix (Frontend)
1. Clear all cached document data
2. Force refresh the document list on page load
3. Ensure document IDs come only from the current API response

### Code Changes Needed

#### In `upload-working.html`
1. Clear any cached document IDs on page load:
```javascript
// Add at the beginning of the script
localStorage.removeItem('cached_documents');
sessionStorage.clear();
```

2. Ensure `loadUserFiles()` is called on every page load:
```javascript
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async () => {
    // Clear any stale data
    sessionStorage.clear();
    
    // Load fresh data
    await loadUserProfile();
    await loadUserFiles();
});
```

3. Never store document IDs in localStorage/sessionStorage

### Backend Verification
The backend is working correctly:
- ✅ `/api/user/intelligence-simple/documents/{id}/analyze` - Checks user ownership
- ✅ `/api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads/{id}` - Checks user ownership
- ✅ Both return appropriate errors when accessing other users' documents

## Testing Steps
1. Log out completely
2. Clear browser cache and local storage
3. Log in as jeremy.estrella@gmail.com
4. Upload a new document
5. Test analyze and download on YOUR documents only

## Prevention
1. Add user ID validation to all document operations
2. Include user context in all API calls
3. Never cache document IDs client-side
4. Always fetch fresh document lists after operations
