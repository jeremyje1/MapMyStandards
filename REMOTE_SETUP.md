# Remote Repository Setup Guide for A³E

## Option 1: GitHub (Recommended)

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon → "New repository"
3. Repository settings:
   - **Name**: `MapMyStandards` or `A3E-AccreditationEngine`
   - **Description**: `A³E - Autonomous Accreditation & Audit Engine with proprietary intelligence capabilities`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Private (recommended for proprietary code) or Public
   - **Don't initialize** with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

### Step 2: Connect Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 2: GitLab

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitLab
1. Go to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com) and sign in
2. Click "New project" → "Create blank project"
3. Project settings:
   - **Project name**: `MapMyStandards`
   - **Description**: `A³E - Proprietary Accreditation Intelligence Platform`
   - **Visibility**: Private (recommended)
   - **Don't initialize** with README

### Step 2: Connect to GitLab
```bash
# Add GitLab as remote origin
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPOSITORY_NAME.git

# Push to GitLab
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: Azure DevOps

### Step 1: Create Repository on Azure DevOps
1. Go to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) and sign in
2. Create new project or use existing
3. Go to Repos → Initialize with empty repository

### Step 2: Connect to Azure DevOps
```bash
# Add Azure DevOps as remote origin
git remote add origin https://YOUR_ORG@dev.azure.com/YOUR_ORG/YOUR_PROJECT/_git/REPOSITORY_NAME

# Push to Azure DevOps
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## After Setting Up Remote Repository

### Verify Connection
```bash
# Check remote configuration
git remote -v

# Verify push was successful
git log --oneline -5
```

### Set Up Branch Protection (Recommended)
On your remote platform:
1. Go to repository settings
2. Set up branch protection rules for `main` branch
3. Require pull requests for changes
4. Enable status checks

### Set Up CI/CD (Optional)
Your repository includes GitHub Actions configuration in `.github/workflows/`
- Automatic testing on push
- Docker image building
- Deployment automation

## Environment Variables for Production
After setting up the remote repository, update these in your deployment environment:
- Repository URL in deployment scripts
- Container registry settings
- Domain configuration for production

## Next Steps
1. Choose your preferred platform (GitHub recommended)
2. Create the repository
3. Run the connection commands
4. Verify the push was successful
5. Set up any additional security or CI/CD features

Your A³E system with all proprietary capabilities will then be safely stored and version-controlled in the cloud!
