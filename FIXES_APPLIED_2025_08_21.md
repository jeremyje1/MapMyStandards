# Fixes Applied - August 21, 2025

## 1. Fixed Trial Signup Error (Critical)

**Issue**: Trial signup was failing with error:
```
run_in_executor() got an unexpected keyword argument 'email'
```

**Root Cause**: When we replaced `asyncio.to_thread` with `loop.run_in_executor` for Python 3.8 compatibility, we didn't account for the fact that `run_in_executor` doesn't support keyword arguments directly.

**Fix Applied**: Modified `payment_service.py` to use a lambda wrapper:
```python
# Before (broken):
return await loop.run_in_executor(None, func, *f_args, **f_kwargs)

# After (fixed):
return await loop.run_in_executor(None, lambda: func(*f_args, **f_kwargs))
```

## 2. Tailwind CDN Warning

**Issue**: Console warning about using Tailwind CDN in production.

**Status**: 
- Already replaced CDN with built CSS in trial-signup.html files
- Built Tailwind CSS to `/web/static/css/tailwind.css`
- Warning might be from browser cache or a different source
- The main application files don't contain CDN references

## Current Status

1. **Trial Signup**: Should now work correctly with the `run_in_executor` fix
2. **Price Configuration**: Verified live prices are correctly configured
3. **Tailwind Build**: Production-ready CSS build in place

## To Verify

1. Clear browser cache and reload to see if Tailwind warning persists
2. Try a new trial signup - it should work without the 400 error
3. Check `/api/v1/billing/trial/last-failure` after a signup attempt to confirm success
