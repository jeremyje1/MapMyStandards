# Upload Fix and Document Display Issue

## Current Status

### âœ… Upload Fix Implemented
- Changed form field name from 'file' to 'files' in:
  - `web/upload-working.html`
  - `web/upload-enhanced.html`
- This fixes the 422 error

### ðŸ”§ Additional Fix Applied
- Added `loadUserFiles()` call after successful upload to refresh the documents list
- Updated the data field lookup to check for both `evidence` and `documents` fields in the API response

## Issue Investigation

The upload says "successful" but documents don't appear because:

1. **The upload IS working** - Files are being saved to S3/storage and recorded in the backend
2. **The display needs updating** - After upload, the documents list wasn't being refreshed

### Backend Flow
1. File uploads to `/api/user/intelligence-simple/evidence/upload`
2. File is saved to storage (S3 or local)
3. Upload is recorded via `_record_user_upload()` in `user_uploads_store.json`
4. The `/api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads` endpoint returns the list of uploaded documents

### Frontend Issues Fixed
1. Missing refresh after upload - Now calls `loadUserFiles()` after successful upload
2. Wrong field name in API response - Now checks for both `evidence` and `documents` fields

## Deployment Status

### Frontend Changes (Needs Vercel Deploy)
- Modified files:
  - `web/upload-working.html` - Fixed field name AND added auto-refresh
  - `web/upload-enhanced.html` - Fixed field name only

### Backend (No Deploy Needed)
- No backend changes required
- The API was already working correctly

## Testing the Fix

After Vercel deployment:
1. Upload a file at https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/upload-working.html
2. The file should appear immediately in the "Documents Analyzed" section below
3. Refreshing the page should also show all previously uploaded files

## Troubleshooting

If documents still don't appear:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the API response format matches expectations
3. Check if the user's upload data is being persisted correctly in the backend
