# Standards Graph Visualization Fix

## Issue
The "View Graph" button in the standards browser was not producing any visualization when clicked.

## Root Cause
The frontend was calling the wrong API endpoint (`/api/intelligence/standards/graph`) instead of the correct endpoint (`/api/user/intelligence-simple/standards/graph`).

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **API Endpoint Correction**
- Changed the fetch URL from `/api/intelligence/standards/graph` to `/api/user/intelligence-simple/standards/graph`
- Added proper URL encoding for the accreditor parameter
- Added fallback to fetch without accreditor if none is selected

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added check for missing accreditorSelect element
- Added detailed console logging throughout the graph loading process
- Improved error messages with response status and details
- Added proper error display with a user-friendly "No Data" message

### 3. **Data Validation**
- Added checks for empty standards data
- Added validation for graph data structure
- Display informative message when no standards are available
- Added warning in stats section when no data is available for visualization

### 4. **UI Improvements**
- Added "No Standards Data Available" message with icon
- Clear any existing messages when loading new data
- Ensure loading spinner is hidden even on errors
- Added proper styling for the no-data message

### 5. **Debugging Support**
- Added comprehensive console logging with `[Graph]` prefix
- Log visualization type, data availability, and rendering progress
- Log API responses and error details

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. Navigate to the standards browser page
2. Select an accreditor (or leave it on "All")
3. Click the "View Graph" button
4. The graph visualization should either:
   - Display a network/tree visualization of standards relationships
   - Show a "No Standards Data Available" message if no data exists

## Console Logging

The following debug messages will appear in the console:
- `[Graph] Showing graph view` - When button is clicked
- `[Graph] Loading graph data...` - When starting to fetch
- `[Graph] Fetching data for accreditor: [name]` - Shows selected accreditor
- `[Graph] Data loaded successfully: [object]` - Shows the response data
- `[Graph] Updating visualization with type: [type]` - Shows visualization type
- `[Graph] Rendering network graph with X standards` - Shows rendering progress

## API Response Structure

The endpoint should return:
```json
{
    "accreditor": "string",
    "total_standards": number,
    "standards": {
        "id": {
            "title": "string",
            "category": "string"
        }
    },
    "relationships": [
        {
            "source": "id",
            "target": "id"
        }
    ],
    "available_accreditors": ["string"]
}
```

## Additional Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- All existing functionality is preserved
- The graph supports three visualization types: network, tree, and radial
- D3.js is loaded dynamically only when needed for tree visualizations
