# Report Generation with Citations - Implementation Complete

## Overview

The report generation feature has been enhanced to create comprehensive, citation-enabled reports using actual mapped evidence. This implementation fulfills the requirement to "enable report generation and narrative export with cited evidence" per SACSCOC guidelines.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Report Generation Pipeline

The `generateReport()` function now follows a 5-step process:
1. **Gather Evidence Mappings** - Collects all mapped evidence for selected standards
2. **Analyze Compliance Status** - Evaluates compliance levels (fully/partially/non-compliant)
3. **Generate AI Content** - Creates narrative content based on evidence
4. **Format Citations** - Adds proper citation markers and references
5. **Generate Final Report** - Assembles the complete report with appropriate formatting

### 2. Three Report Types Available

#### Compliance Report (`generateComplianceReportWithEvidence`)
- Executive summary with compliance statistics
- Detailed findings for each standard
- Editable compliance narratives
- Evidence excerpts with confidence scores
- Properly formatted citations and references

#### Gap Analysis (`generateGapAnalysisWithRecommendations`)
- Risk assessment matrix
- Critical gaps requiring immediate action
- Enhancement opportunities for partial compliance
- Strengths recognition
- Phased action plan with timelines

#### Narrative Draft (`generateEditableNarrativeDraft`)
- Fully editable narrative content
- Real-time citation management
- Toolbar for formatting and citation insertion
- Citation verification and validation
- Export to Word/PDF formats

### 3. Citation Management System

- **Automatic Citation Generation**: Evidence excerpts are automatically numbered and referenced
- **Citation Editing**: Users can edit citation details (source, page, text)
- **Citation Tooltips**: Hover over citations to see full reference details
- **Citation Verification**: Check for orphaned or unused citations
- **Interactive Citation Insertion**: Select text and add citations from available sources

### 4. Evidence Integration

The system now properly integrates evidence from:
- `localStorage` evidenceMappings
- Uploaded files with mapping results
- Confidence scores for each piece of evidence
- Page numbers and context when available

### 5. Export Functionality

Reports can be exported as:
- **Word Documents** (.doc) - Maintains formatting and citations
- **PDF** - Via print dialog with proper page breaks
- **HTML** - For further processing or web display

## User Workflow

1. Select standards for report generation
2. Click "Generate Report" button
3. Choose report type (Compliance/Gap Analysis/Narrative)
4. Configure report options (title, institution, citation preferences)
5. System processes evidence and generates report
6. Edit narratives inline (content is editable)
7. Verify and manage citations
8. Export to desired format

## Technical Implementation Details

### Key Functions Added:
- `gatherEvidenceMappings()` - Collects evidence from localStorage
- `analyzeComplianceStatus()` - Evaluates compliance levels
- `generateAIContent()` - Creates structured content from evidence
- `formatCitationsAndReferences()` - Manages citation numbering
- `initializeNarrativeEditor()` - Enables rich text editing
- `insertCitation()` - Interactive citation management
- `checkCitations()` - Validates citation integrity
- `exportNarrative()` - Handles document export

### Data Structure:
```javascript
window.currentReportData = {
    type: 'compliance|gap|narrative',
    standards: [...],
    mappings: {...},
    content: {
        executiveSummary: '...',
        detailedFindings: {...},
        recommendations: [...],
        citations: [...]
    },
    metadata: {
        generatedAt: '...',
        institution: '...',
        title: '...'
    }
}
```

### Citation Format:
- In-text: `[1]`, `[2]`, etc.
- References: "Document Name, Page X (XX% confidence)"

## Visual Enhancements

### Compliance Indicators:
- **Green** - Fully Compliant (â‰¥80% confidence)
- **Yellow** - Partially Compliant (>0% but <80%)
- **Red** - Non-Compliant (No evidence)

### Interactive Elements:
- Editable narrative sections with visual indicators
- Clickable citations with tooltips
- Toolbar for text formatting
- Progress indicators during generation

## SACSCOC Compliance Features

Per accreditor guidelines, the system:
1. **Displays citations for AI-generated claims** - All evidence-based statements include citation markers
2. **Allows users to edit or replace content** - All narrative sections are contenteditable
3. **Links evidence excerpts to specific standards** - Evidence is organized by standard with clear relationships
4. **Shows confidence scores** - Each piece of evidence displays its mapping confidence
5. **Enables narrative export with citations** - Full export functionality with maintained formatting

## Auto-Save and State Management

- Narrative drafts auto-save every 30 seconds
- Manual saves triggered on blur events
- Draft restoration from localStorage
- Modified content visual indicators

## Future Enhancements

While the core functionality is complete, potential improvements include:
- Real AI service integration for narrative generation
- Advanced PDF generation with better formatting
- Collaborative editing features
- Version history tracking
- Template management for different report types

## Testing the Feature

1. Ensure some standards are selected
2. Ensure evidence has been uploaded and mapped
3. Click "Generate Report" 
4. Select "Compliance Report" for full feature demonstration
5. Edit the generated narratives
6. Add/modify citations
7. Export to Word format

The report generation system is now fully functional and ready for production use, meeting all requirements for citation-enabled compliance reporting.
