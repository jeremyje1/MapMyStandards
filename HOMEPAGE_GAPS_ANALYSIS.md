# Homepage Claims vs Implementation Gaps Analysis

## 1. Standards Database Claims

### Homepage Claims:
- "500+ Standards" (in StandardsGraph section)
- "6 Accreditors"

### Current Implementation:
- ✅ 1362 standards loaded (exceeds claim)
- ✅ Multiple accreditors supported

### Action: Update homepage to reflect actual numbers (1300+ standards)

## 2. Integration Claims

### Homepage Claims:
- ✅ Canvas LMS - "Available Now"
- ✅ Google Drive - "Available Now"
- ✅ SharePoint & OneDrive - "Available Now"
- ❌ Dropbox - "Coming Q1 2025"
- ❌ Blackboard Learn - "Coming Q2 2025"
- ❌ Moodle - "Coming Q2 2025"
- ❌ Workday Student - Mentioned in integrations
- ❌ Banner - Mentioned in integrations

### Current Implementation:
- ✅ Canvas integration exists (`CanvasLMSService` in integration_service.py)
- ⚠️ SharePoint/OneDrive/Google Drive - Need verification
- ❌ Other integrations not found

### Actions Needed:
1. Remove or update timeline for unimplemented integrations
2. Verify SharePoint/OneDrive/Google Drive functionality
3. Update "Coming Soon" dates to reflect reality

## 3. Performance Metrics Claims

### Homepage Claims:
- "87% Mapping Accuracy" 
- "95% Top-3 Accuracy"
- "32hrs Saved Weekly"
- "0.06 Risk Reduction"
- "<1s Instant Mapping"
- "<100ms Retrieval"

### Current Implementation:
- ✅ AI mapping functionality exists
- ⚠️ Specific accuracy metrics not verified
- ⚠️ Time savings not measured

### Actions Needed:
1. Either validate these metrics or update to "Up to X%" format
2. Add analytics to measure actual performance

## 4. Security Claims

### Homepage Claims:
- "SOC 2 Type II" compliance
- "FERPA compliant"
- "256-bit encryption"

### Current Implementation:
- ⚠️ No evidence of SOC 2 certification
- ✅ HTTPS/TLS encryption in place
- ⚠️ FERPA compliance not documented

### Actions Needed:
1. Remove SOC 2 claim unless certified
2. Change to "SOC 2 ready" or "Security best practices"
3. Document FERPA compliance measures

## 5. Feature Claims

### Verified Features:
- ✅ AI-powered document analysis
- ✅ Standards mapping
- ✅ Dashboard with metrics
- ✅ Report generation
- ✅ Multi-user support (auth system)
- ✅ API access
- ✅ Document upload
- ✅ Org chart builder

### Missing/Unverified Features:
- ❌ "Predictive analytics" for gap prevention
- ⚠️ "Team workspaces" (basic auth exists, but no workspace management)
- ⚠️ "Real-time updates" (needs verification)
- ❌ Advanced role-based access control
- ❌ Webhook support for integrations

## 6. Immediate Actions Required

### High Priority (Misleading Claims):
1. Update integration section to only show implemented integrations
2. Remove SOC 2 claim or change to "Security-first design"
3. Update standards count to "1300+" instead of "500+"
4. Remove specific accuracy percentages or add "up to" qualifier

### Medium Priority (Feature Gaps):
1. Implement basic webhook support
2. Add role-based access control
3. Create team workspace functionality
4. Add integration status page

### Low Priority (Enhancements):
1. Add analytics to measure actual time savings
2. Implement predictive gap analysis
3. Add more detailed audit trails

## Recommended Homepage Updates

1. **Standards Section**: Change "500+ Standards" to "1300+ Standards"
2. **Integrations**: Remove unimplemented integrations or clearly mark as "Roadmap"
3. **Security**: Change "SOC 2 Type II" to "Enterprise-grade Security"
4. **Metrics**: Add "Up to" before specific percentages or use ranges
5. **Add disclaimer**: "Features and metrics based on typical usage patterns"
