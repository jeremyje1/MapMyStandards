# Upload Issue Diagnosis & Solution üîç

## Current Status
The upload functionality is still failing with 404 errors because the backend deployment has issues.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Router Conflict**
- Both `documents_simple` and `documents_enhanced` routers were using the same prefix `/api/documents`
- The simple router was loaded first, blocking the enhanced router
- **Fixed**: Disabled the simple router

### 2. **Backend Deployment Issues**
- The API is returning 500 errors after deployment
- This suggests there might be import errors or missing dependencies
- The `documents_enhanced_fixed.py` might have unresolved imports

### 3. **Frontend Polling**
- The frontend was polling `/api/documents/notifications` every 3 seconds
- This endpoint doesn't exist yet, causing 404 errors
- **Fixed**: Disabled notification polling

## Immediate Workaround

While we fix the backend, you can use the existing upload functionality:

1. **Use the intelligence-simple upload endpoint** (already working)
   - This is what the old upload.html uses
   - It doesn't have S3 integration but it works

2. **Temporary Solution**: Update the upload-enhanced-v2.html to use the working endpoint:

```javascript
// Instead of /api/documents/upload
const response = await fetch('/api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
    },
    body: formData
});
```

## Proper Fix (Backend)

The issue is likely in the imports. The enhanced documents router uses:
```python
from ...core.database import get_db
from ..dependencies import get_current_user
from ...models.document import Document
from ...services.storage_service import StorageService
```

These imports might be failing. To fix:

1. Check Railway logs for the exact error
2. Fix the import paths
3. Ensure all dependencies are available
4. Redeploy

## Alternative Solution

Create a minimal working version:
1. Start with a simple upload endpoint
2. Add features incrementally
3. Test each deployment

## Next Steps

1. **Check Railway logs**:
   ```bash
   railway logs
   ```

2. **Create a minimal documents API** without complex dependencies

3. **Test locally first**:
   ```bash
   cd src/a3e
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

4. **Use existing working endpoints** until the new API is fixed

## Summary

The upload is failing because:
- ‚ùå New documents API has deployment issues (500 errors)
- ‚ùå Frontend is trying to use endpoints that don't exist (404 errors)
- ‚úÖ Frontend navigation and authentication are working
- ‚úÖ Existing intelligence-simple endpoints are still functional

The quickest fix is to use the existing working endpoints while we debug the new API deployment.
