git commit -m "Fix document uploads with AWS S3 storage

- Replaced local file storage with AWS S3/cloud storage
- Added proper file content validation (skip 0 byte files)
- Generate unique storage keys for each upload
- Store metadata with each file
- Return storage type in upload response

This fixes the 0 bytes issue on Railway deployment.
Documents will now persist properly in S3.

Required env vars on Railway:
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_REGION
- S3_BUCKET_NAME

See AWS_S3_UPLOAD_SETUP.md for configuration guide."
