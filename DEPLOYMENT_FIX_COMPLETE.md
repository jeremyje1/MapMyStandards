# 🎉 Root Cause Found and Fixed!

## The Problem
The `documents` table uses `institution_id` as a required column, but our code was trying to insert into `organization_id` (which doesn't exist as a column name).

## The Fix
✅ Updated the INSERT query to use correct column names:
- Changed `organization_id` → `institution_id`
- Added required fields: `original_filename`, `file_path`, `mime_type`

## Deployment Status
✅ Code fix committed and pushed to GitHub  
⏳ Railway will auto-deploy in ~2-3 minutes  

## What Happens Next
1. Railway detects the new commit
2. Automatically builds and deploys
3. New backend will use correct column names
4. Uploads will start working!

## How to Verify
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
2. Check Railway dashboard for deployment status
3. Once deployed, upload a document
4. Run the console check:
   ```javascript
   const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token');
   fetch('https://api.mapmystandards.ai/api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads', {
     headers: {'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`}
   }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);
   ```
5. You should see your uploaded documents!

## Timeline
- ✅ Schema fixed (columns added)
- ✅ Code fixed (column names corrected)
- ⏳ Deployment in progress (2-3 min)
- 🔜 Uploads will work!

The issue was a simple column name mismatch. Once Railway deploys this fix, your uploads will persist properly!
