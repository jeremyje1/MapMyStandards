# MapMyStandards Fix Summary - September 4, 2025

## Current Status: 
- **Deployment Time**: 12:52 PM CST
- **API Status**: Deployment in progress (API not yet responding)
- **Next Check**: Wait 5-10 minutes for deployment to complete

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Stripe Webhook Signature Validation Failure
**Problem**: Webhook requests from Stripe were being rejected with "Invalid webhook signature"
**Root Cause**: Wrong webhook secret in Railway environment
**Solution**: 
- Updated STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET in Railway to: `whsec_IrKVrLesP6FOD2wo08nYf6FmOf9zULTU`
- Updated railway.env file for consistency

### 2. Database Schema Conflict
**Problem**: Foreign key constraint error preventing user signups from being stored
```
Foreign key constraint 'institution_accreditor_institution_id_fkey' cannot be implemented
Key columns "institution_id" and "id" are of incompatible types: character varying and uuid.
```
**Root Cause**: Conflicting model definitions in two files:
- `/src/a3e/models/__init__.py` (correct models with UUID)
- `/src/a3e/database/models.py` (old models with VARCHAR)

**Solution**: 
- Renamed conflicting file: `src/a3e/database/models.py` â†’ `src/a3e/database/models_old.py.backup`
- This ensures only the correct models from `/src/a3e/models/__init__.py` are used

### 3. Pinecone Embedding Errors
**Problem**: "Failed to index standards: 'list' object has no attribute 'tolist'"
**Root Cause**: Dummy SentenceTransformer returns a list, but code expects numpy array
**Solution**: 
- Added type checking in `pinecone_service.py`:
```python
# Convert to list if it's not already (handles both numpy arrays and lists)
if hasattr(embedding, 'tolist'):
    embedding = embedding.tolist()
```

## Deployment Status
- Code fixes committed and pushed to GitHub
- Railway will automatically redeploy with fixes
- Webhook secret updated in Railway environment

## Next Steps
1. Monitor Railway logs to confirm successful deployment
2. Test user signup flow to verify database writes are working
3. Confirm Stripe webhooks are being processed correctly
4. Check that Pinecone indexing errors are resolved

## Important Notes
- The onboarding page message "We could not detect your signup email" should resolve once webhooks are processed correctly
- Users should now be properly stored in the PostgreSQL database after signup
- The association tables now have correct type matching (UUID for institution_id)
