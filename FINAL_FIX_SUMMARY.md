# 🎉 UPLOADS ARE WORKING - Display Issue Only!

## Current Status
✅ **Uploads are being saved successfully to the database!**

Your documents in the database:
1. **2024PrinciplesOfAccreditation SACSCOC.pdf** - Uploaded successfully
2. **QEP-Final-4.11.24.pdf** - Uploaded successfully  
3. test-upload.pdf (test file)

## The Issue
The uploads work but the page shows "0 files" because the display isn't refreshing properly.

## Quick Fix - Refresh the Documents List
Run this in your browser console to manually refresh the documents:

```javascript
// First, check what the API returns
const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token');
fetch('https://api.mapmystandards.ai/api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads', {
  headers: {'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`}
}).then(r => r.json()).then(data => {
  console.log('API Response:', data);
  // If data has documents, try to display them
  if (data.evidence && data.evidence.length > 0) {
    console.log('Found', data.evidence.length, 'documents');
    // Force refresh the display
    window.loadUserFiles && window.loadUserFiles();
  }
});
```

## Permanent Fix Needed
The `loadUserFiles()` function in the page needs to be called after upload success. This should happen automatically but isn't working.

## Workaround
After uploading a file:
1. Refresh the entire page (F5)
2. Your documents should appear

## What's Working
- ✅ File upload to S3
- ✅ Database recording
- ✅ Backend API
- ❌ Auto-refresh after upload (frontend issue)

Your uploads ARE being saved - it's just a display refresh issue!
