# Dynamic Risk Analysis Implementation - Complete

## Overview
The GapRisk Predictorâ„¢ now dynamically updates risk scores in real-time as evidence is mapped to or removed from standards.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture
- Custom `evidenceMapped` events are dispatched whenever evidence is mapped or unmapped
- Event listeners automatically trigger risk score recalculation
- Works across all evidence mapping workflows

### 2. Real-Time Updates
- Risk scores update immediately when:
  - Evidence is mapped via the pipeline workflow
  - Evidence is mapped from the evidence library
  - Evidence mappings are removed
  - Documents are uploaded and mapped

### 3. Visual Feedback
- Risk buttons show updated risk levels with color-coded indicators:
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green dot = Low Risk
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow dot = Medium Risk  
  - ðŸ”´ Red dot = High Risk
- Temporary checkmark appears when risk is recalculated
- Risk modal updates if open during changes

### 4. Smart Caching
- LRU cache system prevents unnecessary API calls
- Cache is cleared for affected standards when evidence changes
- Automatic cache eviction when capacity reached

## Technical Implementation

### Event Dispatch Points
1. **Pipeline Mapping** (lines 3934-3939)
   ```javascript
   selectedStandards.forEach(standardId => {
       window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('evidenceMapped', {
           detail: { standardId }
       }));
   });
   ```

2. **Evidence Library Mapping** (lines 4544-4549)
   ```javascript
   window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('evidenceMapped', {
       detail: { standardId }
   }));
   ```

3. **Mapping Removal** (lines 6788-6791)
   ```javascript
   window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('evidenceMapped', {
       detail: { standardId }
   }));
   ```

### Update Function (lines 6851-6908)
```javascript
async function updateRiskDisplay(standardId) {
    // Find risk button with flexible selector
    // Fetch fresh risk score from API
    // Update button visual with risk level
    // Add temporary success indicator
    // Update cache with new score
    // Refresh modal if open
}
```

### Event Listener (lines 6837-6847)
```javascript
window.addEventListener('evidenceMapped', (event) => {
    // Update evidence library if open
    // Clear cache for affected standard
    // Trigger risk display update
});
```

## User Experience

### Before
- Risk scores remained static after evidence mapping
- Users had to refresh page to see updated risks
- No visual feedback on risk changes

### After  
- Risk scores update instantly when evidence is mapped
- Visual indicators show risk level changes
- Success checkmarks confirm updates
- Modal content refreshes if viewing risk details

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. Map evidence via pipeline â†’ Risk updates âœ“
2. Map evidence from library â†’ Risk updates âœ“
3. Remove evidence mapping â†’ Risk updates âœ“
4. Multiple standards â†’ Each updates independently âœ“
5. Risk modal open â†’ Content refreshes âœ“

### Test File
Created `test_risk_update.html` to verify event system works correctly.

## API Integration
- Uses `/api/v1/risk/score-standard-dynamic` endpoint
- Passes standard_id and accreditor
- Receives updated risk factors including:
  - Overall risk level and score
  - Evidence coverage percentage
  - Trust score based on evidence quality
  - Staleness factor
  - Evidence metadata (count, verification status)

## Benefits
1. **Real-time Feedback**: Users see immediate impact of evidence mapping
2. **Better Decision Making**: Dynamic scores help prioritize which standards need more evidence
3. **Improved Workflow**: No need to manually refresh or re-open risk analysis
4. **Visual Clarity**: Color coding and indicators make risk levels obvious

## Next Steps
The dynamic risk analysis feature is now fully integrated and operational. Consider:
1. Adding risk trend charts to show how scores change over time
2. Email alerts when standards move to high-risk status
3. Batch risk analysis across all standards
4. Risk comparison between accreditation cycles
