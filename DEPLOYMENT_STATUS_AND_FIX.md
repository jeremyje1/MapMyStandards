# Deployment Status and Upload Fix

## 🚨 Current Issue
Your uploads are not persisting because the backend on Railway is still using the old JSON file storage, which gets deleted on every deployment.

## 📊 What We've Done

### Frontend (Vercel) ✅
- Fixed form field name (`file` → `files`)
- Fixed document display fields
- Added auto-refresh after upload
- Updated all upload links

### Backend (Railway) ⏳ PENDING DEPLOYMENT
- Changed from JSON file to PostgreSQL database
- Added proper file size tracking
- Made uploads persistent across deployments

## 🔧 Why Uploads Don't Show

1. **File uploads successfully** → Goes to S3 ✅
2. **Backend records it** → In temporary JSON file ⚠️
3. **Railway redeploys** → JSON file deleted 💥
4. **Your uploads disappear** → Database would prevent this

## 🚀 Action Required

### Check Railway Dashboard
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Look for "MapMyStandards" service
3. Check if there's a deployment in progress or pending

### If No Auto-Deploy:
1. In Railway, click on the service
2. Go to Settings → Deploy
3. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"
4. Wait for deployment to complete (~2-5 minutes)

### Verify Deployment
After deployment, the uploads will:
- Show correct file sizes (not 0 bytes)
- Persist across Railway restarts
- Appear in your documents list

## 🧪 Quick Test

Once deployed, test by:
1. Upload a file at https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/upload-working.html
2. Note the "Upload Successful" message
3. Check if file appears in the list below
4. Refresh the page - file should still be there
5. Wait 30 minutes and check again - should still persist

## 💡 Alternative Checks

Run this in your browser console:
```javascript
// Check if backend is using database
fetch('https://api.mapmystandards.ai/health')
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => console.log('API Health:', data));

// Check your uploads
fetch('https://api.mapmystandards.ai/api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('access_token')}`
  }
})
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => console.log('My uploads:', data));
```

## 🎯 Expected Result After Deployment

Your documents section should show:
- Uploaded files with correct names
- Actual file sizes (not 0 bytes)
- Upload timestamps
- Files persist permanently

The backend deployment is the final piece needed to make uploads work properly!
