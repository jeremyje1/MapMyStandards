### 3. API Endpoints ✅
**Files Created:**
- `src/a3e/api/routes/teams.py` - Team management endpoints:
  - POST /teams - Create team
  - GET /teams - List user's teams
  - GET /teams/{id} - Get team details
  - PUT /teams/{id} - Update team
  - GET /teams/{id}/members - List members
  - POST /teams/{id}/invite - Invite member
  - PUT /teams/{id}/members/{user_id}/role - Update role
  - DELETE /teams/{id}/members/{user_id} - Remove member
  - POST /teams/accept-invite - Accept invitation

- `src/a3e/api/routes/audit_logs.py` - Audit endpoints:
  - GET /audit-logs/teams/{id}/audit-logs - Team activity
  - GET /audit-logs/users/me/audit-logs - User activity
  - GET /audit-logs/resources/{type}/{id}/history - Resource history
  - GET /audit-logs/teams/{id}/activity-summary - Activity summary

### 4. Frontend Pages ✅
**Files Created:**
- `web/team-settings.html` - Comprehensive team management UI with:
  - Team details display
  - Member management with roles
  - Invitation system
  - API key management (placeholder)
  - Audit log viewer
  - Team settings

### 5. Integration Updates ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `src/a3e/api/routes/__init__.py` - Registered new routers
- `src/a3e/database/__init__.py` - Exported enterprise models

## Architecture Decisions

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Owner**: Full control, can delete team
- **Admin**: Can manage team and members
- **Manager**: Can create/edit content
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

### Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
- All resources (org_charts, scenarios, etc.) now have team_id
- Data queries filtered by team membership
- API endpoints enforce team permissions

### Audit Trail
- All create/update/delete actions logged
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Changes tracked with before/after values
- Compliance-ready audit trail

## Next Steps

### Remaining Features:
1. **SSO Integration**
   - SAML 2.0 support
   - OAuth providers (Google, Microsoft)
   - Two-factor authentication

2. **Advanced Export/Reporting**
   - Scheduled reports
   - Custom templates
   - Multi-format export

3. **API Key Management UI**
   - Create/revoke keys
   - Usage analytics
   - Rate limiting

4. **Enterprise Dashboard**
   - Cross-team analytics
   - Executive summaries
   - Performance metrics

## Testing Needed
1. Run database migration
2. Test team creation and management
3. Verify RBAC enforcement
4. Check audit log capture
5. Test invitation flow

## Environment Variables Needed
```env
# Frontend URL for invitation links
FRONTEND_URL=https://platform.mapmystandards.ai

# Session security
SESSION_SECRET_KEY=<generate-secure-key>
SESSION_EXPIRE_HOURS=168
```

## Status: 60% Complete
Core enterprise features implemented. SSO, advanced reporting, and enterprise dashboard remaining.
