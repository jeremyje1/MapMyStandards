Hi [Customer],

I sincerely apologize - our trial system had a technical issue and you were charged immediately instead of receiving the 7-day free trial as advertised.

I am processing a full refund of $49.99 right now. You should see this back on your card within 2-3 business days.

We're fixing the trial system and will contact you when it's working properly if you'd still like to try the platform.

Again, my apologies for this error.
