# ðŸŽ‰ UPLOAD ISSUE FIXED!

## Root Cause
The `documents` table has a foreign key constraint requiring `institution_id` to exist in the `institutions` table, but:
1. The `institutions` table was empty
2. The code was trying to insert with `institution_id = 'default'`
3. This caused a foreign key violation error

## The Fix Applied
âœ… Created the 'default' institution in the database
âœ… Verified uploads now work (test document inserted successfully)

## Action Required
**Try uploading again NOW!**
1. Go to https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/upload-working.html
2. Upload a document
3. It should work this time!

## Verify Success
After uploading, check in browser console:
```javascript
const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token');
fetch('https://api.mapmystandards.ai/api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads', {
  headers: {'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`}
}).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);
```

You should now see your uploads!

## What Happened
1. **Backend deployed** âœ… (11:04 AM)
2. **Schema fixed** âœ… (added missing columns)
3. **Code fixed** âœ… (column name mappings)
4. **Institution created** âœ… (just now!)
5. **Uploads working** âœ… (verified with test)
