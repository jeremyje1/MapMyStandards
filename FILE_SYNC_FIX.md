# File Upload Synchronization Fix

## Summary
This document details the fix implemented to resolve inconsistent file handling between the Dashboard's AI Evidence section and the main upload page.

## Problem Description
- Files uploaded via the Dashboard's AI Evidence section remained in "queued" status indefinitely
- Files uploaded via the main upload page showed "complete" status but weren't recognized by the AI Evidence module
- Different upload methods used different localStorage keys and data structures, causing synchronization issues

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Dashboard AI Evidence**: Used its own local storage (`mms:recentUploads`) without syncing to the main `uploadedFiles` array
2. **Main Upload Page**: Updated various storage keys but didn't sync to the unified `uploadedFiles` array
3. **Standards Browser**: Only read from `uploadedFiles` array, missing files uploaded through other methods
4. **No Cross-Page Communication**: Pages didn't listen for file upload events from other tabs/pages

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Unified Storage Structure
All upload methods now sync to a single `uploadedFiles` localStorage array with consistent structure:
```javascript
{
    name: string,           // File name
    id: string,            // File ID from server
    uploadDate: string,    // ISO date string
    mappingStatus: string, // 'not_mapped' | 'mapped' | 'mapping'
    source: string,        // 'dashboard_ai_evidence' | 'main_upload'
    size: number,          // File size in bytes (optional)
    jobId: string          // Job ID for tracking (optional)
}
```

### 2. Dashboard AI Evidence Updates
Modified `syncUploadStatus()` function in `dashboard-modern.html`:
- Added synchronization with main `uploadedFiles` array
- Files are added when status becomes 'complete'
- Existing files are updated if already present
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing storage

### 3. Main Upload Page Updates
Modified `pollJob()` function in `upload-modern.html`:
- Added synchronization when upload completes successfully
- Stores file metadata in unified `uploadedFiles` array
- Emits custom event for cross-page communication

### 4. Cross-Page Event System
Added event listeners in `standards-modern.html`:
- `fileUploadUpdate` custom event for same-page updates
- `storage` event for cross-tab synchronization
- Automatically refreshes evidence status display when files are uploaded

## Benefits
1. **Consistent Status**: Files show the same status regardless of where they were uploaded
2. **Cross-Module Recognition**: AI Evidence module recognizes files from main upload and vice versa
3. **Real-Time Updates**: Evidence status updates immediately when files are uploaded from any page
4. **Unified Experience**: Users see consistent file information across all modules

## Testing Recommendations
1. Upload files via Dashboard AI Evidence section and verify they appear in Standards Browser
2. Upload files via main upload page and verify they're recognized by AI Evidence
3. Test cross-tab synchronization by uploading in one tab and checking another
4. Verify file mapping works regardless of upload source
5. Check that existing files aren't duplicated when syncing

## Future Improvements
1. Consider migrating all file storage to a single API endpoint
2. Add file deduplication based on content hash
3. Implement server-side synchronization for better reliability
4. Add progress tracking across all upload methods
