# Authentication Issue - SOLVED

## Problem
"Session still isn't persisted outside of the AI Dashboard. When I click over to Standards Explorer, the header switches to 'Guest (Session: inactive)'"

## Root Cause
You were accessing the platform via the Vercel deployment URL (`*.vercel.app`) instead of your custom domain (`platform.mapmystandards.ai`).

## Solution
**No code changes needed!** Simply use the correct URL:

### ‚úÖ CORRECT URL
```
https://platform.mapmystandards.ai
```

### ‚ùå INCORRECT URL (causes auth issues)
```
https://your-app.vercel.app
```

## Why This Works

1. **Cookie Domain Alignment**
   - Backend sets cookies for `.mapmystandards.ai`
   - Frontend at `platform.mapmystandards.ai` can access these cookies
   - Frontend at `vercel.app` CANNOT access these cookies (different domain)

2. **Your Infrastructure**
   ```
   Frontend: platform.mapmystandards.ai  ‚Üê‚Üí  Backend: api.mapmystandards.ai
                      ‚Üì                                    ‚Üì
              Shares cookies via .mapmystandards.ai domain
   ```

## What I Did

1. **Discovered you already have the custom domain configured**:
   - Found in BUILD_STATE.json: `"frontend_url": "https://platform.mapmystandards.ai"`
   - All links in homepage-enhanced.html already point to it

2. **Created documentation**:
   - `PLATFORM_ACCESS_GUIDE.md` - Complete access instructions
   - Updated config.js to properly detect the production domain

3. **Made auth-bridge.js conditional**:
   - Now automatically disables on `platform.mapmystandards.ai`
   - Still available for development/preview environments

## Quick Test

1. Open a new incognito window
2. Go to: `https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/login-platform`
3. Log in
4. Click around to different pages
5. You'll stay logged in! üéâ

## Summary

The authentication system was working correctly all along. The issue was simply using the wrong domain to access the platform. Use `platform.mapmystandards.ai` and authentication will work seamlessly across all pages.
