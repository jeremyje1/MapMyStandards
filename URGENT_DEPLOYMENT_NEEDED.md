# 🚨 URGENT: Backend Deployment Required

## Current Status
- ✅ Frontend is working (shows "Upload Successful")
- ✅ Files are uploading to S3 storage
- ❌ Upload records are NOT persisting (stored in temporary JSON file)
- ❌ API returns: `{evidence: Array(0), total: 0}` (no uploads found)

## The Problem
Your Railway backend is using the OLD code that stores uploads in a JSON file. This file gets DELETED every time Railway restarts/redeploys, which is why your uploads disappear.

## The Solution (Already Coded)
We've updated the backend to use PostgreSQL database, but it needs to be DEPLOYED to Railway.

## 🎯 Action Required NOW

### Option 1: Check Railway Auto-Deploy
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find your "MapMyStandards" project
3. Check if there's a deployment in progress from the recent GitHub push
4. If yes, wait for it to complete (~3-5 minutes)

### Option 2: Manual Deploy (if no auto-deploy)
1. In Railway, click on your backend service
2. Go to "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy" button
4. Select the latest commit (should mention "database" or "PostgreSQL")
5. Wait for deployment to complete

### Option 3: Check Deploy Settings
1. In Railway, go to Settings → Deploys
2. Ensure "Auto Deploy" is enabled for the main branch
3. If not, enable it and trigger a manual deploy

## 🧪 How to Verify Deployment Success

After deployment completes, run this in browser console again:
```javascript
fetch('https://api.mapmystandards.ai/api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${localStorage.getItem('access_token')}`
  }
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(data => {
  console.log('Deployment successful?', data.evidence ? 'YES' : 'Checking...');
  console.log('Total uploads:', data.evidence?.length || 0);
});
```

## 📋 What Happens After Deployment

1. **Immediate**: New uploads will be saved to PostgreSQL
2. **Persistent**: Uploads survive Railway restarts
3. **Visible**: Your documents will appear in the list
4. **Reliable**: No more lost uploads!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Old uploads (before deployment) are lost - they were in the temporary JSON file
- After deployment, all new uploads will persist permanently
- The `documents` table will be created automatically on first run

## 🔥 Quick Deploy Check

Look for these signs in Railway:
- Recent deployment (within last hour)
- Deployment logs mentioning "PostgreSQL" or "documents table"
- Green status indicator
- No error messages

**The backend MUST be deployed for uploads to work properly!**
