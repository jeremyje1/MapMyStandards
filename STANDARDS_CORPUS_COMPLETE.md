# Standards Corpus Implementation Complete

## Summary
All six regional accreditor standards have been successfully implemented as comprehensive YAML files in the `data/standards/` directory.

## Completed Files
1. **SACSCOC** (`sacscoc.yaml`) - 27 standards with sections 4-14
2. **HLC** (`hlc.yaml`) - 16 standards with 5 main criteria
3. **MSCHE** (`msche.yaml`) - 8 standards plus requirements of affiliation
4. **WASC** (`wasc.yaml`) - 8 standards with 4 main standards plus CFRs
5. **NWCCU** (`nwccu.yaml`) - 13 standards covering Standard One and Two
6. **NECHE** (`neche.yaml`) - 63 standards covering 9 main standard areas

## Statistics
- **Total Standards**: 135 across all accreditors
- **Total Clauses**: 259
- **Total Indicators**: 1,029
- **Average Indicators per Clause**: 3-5

## Features Implemented
### 1. YAML Structure
Each file follows a consistent structure:
```yaml
accreditor: [ACCREDITOR_CODE]
version: "2024"
effective_date: "2024-01-01"
metadata:
  name: [Full Accreditor Name]
  version: "2024"
  last_updated: "2024-01-01"
  source_url: [Official Website]
  license: "proprietary-summary"
  disclaimer: "Paraphrased summaries for development."
  coverage_notes: [Coverage description]
standards:
  - id: [Standard ID]
    title: [Standard Title]
    description: [Standard Description]
    category: [Category Name]
    clauses: [...]
```

### 2. Standards Loader
The `standards_loader.py` module successfully:
- Loads all YAML files from `data/standards/`
- Normalizes IDs with accreditor prefixes (e.g., "1.1" → "SACSCOC_1.1")
- Extracts and caches metadata for API exposure
- Handles version and effective date information

### 3. Testing
Created comprehensive test suites:
- **Unit Tests** (`test_standards_corpus.py`): Validates YAML structure, field presence, and data integrity
- **Integration Tests** (`test_cross_accreditor_matching.py`): Tests cross-accreditor matching functionality
- **Loading Test** (`test_standards_loading.py`): Verifies all files load correctly

### 4. API Integration
The standards are exposed via these endpoints:
- `/api/user/intelligence-simple/standards/metadata` - Returns corpus metadata
- `/api/user/intelligence-simple/standards/cross-accreditor-matches` - Finds equivalent standards across accreditors

## Cross-Accreditor Matching
The system can identify equivalent standards across accreditors based on:
- Keyword overlap analysis
- Title and description similarity
- Configurable threshold and top-k parameters

Example matches:
- Mission standards across all accreditors
- Faculty/teaching standards
- Assessment and effectiveness standards
- Governance and leadership standards

## Notes for Production
1. **License Compliance**: Current content is paraphrased summaries. Replace with licensed text before production deployment.
2. **Version Control**: Each file includes version and effective date metadata for tracking updates.
3. **Extensibility**: Structure supports adding more accreditors or updating existing standards.

## File Management
Renamed placeholder files to `.bak` to prevent parsing errors:
- `sacscoc.sample.yaml` → `sacscoc.sample.yaml.bak`
- `sacscoc.full.placeholder.yaml` → `sacscoc.full.placeholder.yaml.bak`
- `hlc.placeholder.yaml` → `hlc.placeholder.yaml.bak`
- `msche.placeholder.yaml` → `msche.placeholder.yaml.bak`

## Next Steps
1. Review and validate standards accuracy with domain experts
2. Obtain proper licensing for official standards text
3. Implement version tracking for standards updates
4. Add more sophisticated matching algorithms if needed
5. Consider adding standards from specialized/programmatic accreditors
