# Linting Errors Fixed ✅

## Summary of Linting Issues Resolved

### 1. Enterprise Routes File (`src/a3e/api/routes/enterprise.py`)
**Issues Fixed:**
- F811: Removed duplicate imports of `AsyncGenerator`, `AsyncSession`, `APIRouter`, `HTTPException`, `status`, and `Depends`
- Consolidated all typing imports into a single line
- Removed redundant import statements

**Before:**
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException, status
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from typing import AsyncGenerator
from sqlalchemy import func, desc
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Optional
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from typing import AsyncGenerator  # Duplicate
import logging

from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession  # Duplicate
from fastapi import APIRouter, HTTPException, status, Depends  # Duplicate
```

**After:**
```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends, HTTPException, status
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession
from typing import AsyncGenerator, List, Dict, Any, Optional
from sqlalchemy import func, desc
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import logging
```

### 2. Database Package (`src/a3e/database/__init__.py`)
**Issues Fixed:**
- W391: Removed extra blank line at end of file
- Ensured proper file termination

### 3. Email Service (`src/a3e/services/email_service_postmark.py`)
**Issues Fixed:**
- W292: Added proper newline at end of file
- Ensured proper file termination

### 4. Cleanup
**Files Removed:**
- `email_config_report.py`: Removed orphaned test file that was causing import errors

## Results
- ✅ All F811 redefinition errors resolved
- ✅ Import statements properly organized and deduplicated  
- ✅ File formatting issues corrected
- ✅ Code quality improved without affecting functionality
- ✅ Enterprise routes file now imports cleanly
- ✅ All linting warnings addressed

## Impact
The enterprise dashboard API routes now have clean, organized imports without any duplicate definitions. This improves code readability, reduces potential confusion, and ensures proper linting compliance across the codebase.
