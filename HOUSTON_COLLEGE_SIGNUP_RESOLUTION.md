# Houston College Signup Issue - Complete Analysis

## Summary
The Houston College signup is not creating users because the system relies on Stripe webhooks to create users after checkout, but the webhook may not be properly configured or failing.

## How The System Is Designed to Work

### Expected Flow:
1. User fills signup form on website
2. User is redirected to Stripe Checkout (hosted by Stripe)
3. User enters payment information and completes checkout
4. Stripe sends a `checkout.session.completed` webhook to the API
5. **The webhook handler creates the user in the database**
6. User is redirected to trial-success.html
7. Frontend waits for user to be created before proceeding

### What's Actually Happening:
1. ✅ User completes Stripe Checkout successfully
2. ❓ Webhook may not be reaching the API or failing
3. ❌ User is never created in database
4. ❌ When redirected to dashboard, user appears not signed in

## Key Discovery
The `/api/trial/signup` endpoint expects a payment_method_id from Stripe Elements (inline form), but the current flow uses Stripe Checkout (hosted page). These are incompatible:
- Stripe Elements provides payment_method_id directly
- Stripe Checkout handles payment internally and notifies via webhook

## The Real Issues

### 1. Webhook Configuration
The Stripe webhook endpoint must be configured in Stripe Dashboard to point to:
```
https://api.mapmystandards.ai/api/billing/webhook
```

### 2. Webhook Secret
The API needs the webhook secret to validate incoming webhooks. This should be set as an environment variable in Railway.

### 3. User Creation Logic
The user creation happens in the webhook handler (`billing.py` lines 663-703), not in the trial signup endpoint.

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Verify Webhook Configuration
```bash
# In Stripe Dashboard:
# 1. Go to Developers > Webhooks
# 2. Check if webhook endpoint exists for: https://api.mapmystandards.ai/api/billing/webhook
# 3. Ensure "checkout.session.completed" event is selected
# 4. Copy the Webhook Secret (starts with 'whsec_')
```

### 2. Set Webhook Secret in Railway
```bash
railway variables set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### 3. Check Railway Logs for Webhook Errors
```bash
railway logs | grep -i webhook
railway logs | grep -i "checkout.session.completed"
railway logs | grep -i houston
```

### 4. Test Webhook Manually
Use Stripe CLI to test the webhook:
```bash
stripe listen --forward-to https://api.mapmystandards.ai/api/billing/webhook
stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
```

## Why The Fix for Authentication Doesn't Help Here
The authentication fix we implemented ensures existing users can access the dashboard. However, Houston College's issue is that the user was never created in the first place due to the webhook failure.

## Temporary Workaround
Until the webhook is fixed, users can be created manually:
```python
# Use create_user_manually.py script with the Stripe customer ID from the Stripe Dashboard
```

## Long-term Solution
1. Ensure webhook is properly configured and receiving events
2. Add better error handling and logging to webhook endpoint
3. Consider adding a backup user creation method if webhook fails
4. Add monitoring to alert when webhook failures occur
