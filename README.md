# A³E — Autonomous Accreditation & Audit Engine

A3E ingests institutional artefacts (LMS exports, SharePoint docs, SIS data), drops them in a vector store, and orchestrates an LLM‑agent swarm to generate:

* a Standards × Evidence matrix  
* draft narrative text per criterion  
* a traffic‑light gap dashboard  

The stack is polyglot‑friendly but defaults to **Python 3.12**, **Postgres + Milvus**, and AWS Bedrock LLM endpoints.

> **Live demo** – coming soon at https://api.YOURDOMAIN.ai/docs
