# Trial Signup Page Styling Fix

## Issue
The trial signup page at `/trial-signup` was displaying without any CSS styling, appearing as plain HTML.

## Root Cause
The page is served via FastAPI's `FileResponse`, and the Tailwind CSS build might not have included all necessary utility classes used in the HTML.

## Temporary Fix Applied
Added Tailwind CDN as a fallback in `trial-signup.html`:
```html
<!-- Tailwind CSS -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/web/static/css/tailwind.css">
<!-- Temporary fallback for missing classes -->
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

This ensures the page displays correctly while we work on a permanent solution.

## Permanent Solution (TODO)
1. **Ensure all Tailwind classes are built**: 
   - The build process needs to scan all HTML files properly
   - Consider using PurgeCSS safelist for dynamically generated classes

2. **Alternative approach**:
   - Pre-build a complete Tailwind CSS file with all utilities
   - Or use Tailwind's JIT mode with proper content configuration

3. **Remove CDN dependency**:
   - Once the build process is fixed, remove the CDN fallback
   - This will eliminate the console warning about using CDN in production

## Status
- ‚úÖ Page now displays with proper styling (using CDN fallback)
- ‚úÖ Trial signup functionality works
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Console warning about CDN usage will appear (temporary)
- üîÑ Permanent fix pending

The trial signup page is now fully functional with proper styling!
