# 🔍 Upload Status Check

## Current Situation
✅ Backend deployed at 10:28 AM  
✅ Database schema fixed - all columns added  
❌ Documents table is empty - no uploads saved  

## The Timeline
1. **10:28 AM**: Backend deployed with old JSON-based code
2. **10:29 AM**: You tried to upload - got database errors
3. **~10:35 AM**: We fixed the database schema
4. **Now**: Schema is fixed, but no new uploads have been attempted

## Action Required: Test Upload Again!

The database errors you saw in the logs were from BEFORE we fixed the schema. Now that the schema is fixed, you need to:

1. **Upload a new document NOW**
   - Go to: https://platform.mapmystandards.ai/upload-working.html
   - Upload any PDF file
   - You should see "Document uploaded successfully!"

2. **Check Railway logs immediately**
   - Look for NEW log entries (after current time)
   - Should NOT see any database errors
   - Should see successful upload messages

3. **Verify in console again**
   ```javascript
   const token = localStorage.getItem('access_token');
   fetch('https://api.mapmystandards.ai/api/user/intelligence-simple/uploads', {
     headers: {'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`}
   }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);
   ```

## Why Previous Uploads Failed
- The upload at 10:29 AM failed because the `user_id` column didn't exist yet
- We added the columns at ~10:35 AM
- No uploads have been attempted since the fix

## Expected Result
After uploading NOW (with the fixed schema), you should see your document in the response!

**TL;DR: The fix is complete, but you need to upload a NEW document for it to work!**
