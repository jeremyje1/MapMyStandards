# Marketing Page Audit & Fixes

## Summary
Created a new marketing page (`marketing.html`) with all links properly pointing to the platform's internal routes.

## Links Fixed

### Navigation Header
- **Home**: `/` (unchanged - correct)
- **Features**: `/features` (unchanged - correct)
- **Pricing**: `#pricing` (anchor link - correct)
- **Demo**: Changed from `/demo` to `/contact` (no dedicated demo page exists)
- **About**: `/about` (unchanged - correct) 
- **Contact**: `/contact` (unchanged - correct)
- **Sign In**: `/login` (unchanged - correct)
- **Start Free Trial**: Changed from `/trial` to `/trial-signup` (matches existing route)

### System Status Bar
- **System Status**: Changed from `https://api.mapmystandards.ai/status` to `/health` (internal health endpoint)

### Hero Section CTAs
- **Start 7-Day Free Trial**: Changed from `/trial` to `/trial-signup`
- **See Live Demo**: Changed from `/demo` to `/contact`

### Pricing Section
- All "Start Free Trial" buttons: Changed from `/trial?plan=X` to `/trial-signup?plan=X`
- Enterprise "Contact Sales": `/contact?plan=enterprise` (unchanged - correct)

### Footer Links
#### Product Section
- **Features**: `/features` (correct)
- **Pricing**: `/pricing` (correct)
- **Live Demo**: Changed from `/demo` to `/contact`
- **API Documentation**: Changed from `/api/docs` to `/redoc` (actual API docs endpoint)
- **Integrations**: `/integrations` (kept as is - may need page)

#### Support Section
- **System Status**: Changed from `/api/status` to `/health`
- All other support links kept as is

### CTA Section
- **Start Your Free Trial**: Changed from `/trial` to `/trial-signup`
- **Schedule a Demo**: Changed from `/demo` to `/contact`

## Additional Fixes
- Fixed logo text span tag (was incomplete)
- Ensured all CTAs use consistent routing
- Updated pricing toggle JavaScript to properly construct URLs with `/trial-signup`

## Notes
The marketing page is now fully integrated with the platform's routing system. All links point to existing routes or appropriate fallbacks. Some links (like `/blog`, `/careers`, `/press`) may need actual pages created in the future, but they will gracefully fallback to the catch-all route which displays a nice 404 page.
