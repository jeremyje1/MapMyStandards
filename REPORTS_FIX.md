# Reports Fix Implementation

## Issue Summary
The Reports & Analytics page displayed "no mapped evidence found yet" warning even after evidence was uploaded and mapped, and none of the report buttons produced any outputs.

## Root Cause
1. The reports page was using `/api/v1/evidence/map` endpoint which returned in-memory mock data
2. Report generation endpoints returned mock "processing" responses instead of real reports
3. Evidence data was stored in the database but not accessible to the reports interface

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Database-backed Evidence Endpoint
**File:** `src/a3e/api/routes/evidence_map_database.py`
- New endpoint: `/api/v1/evidence/map-database`
- Queries `StandardMapping` table for real evidence data
- Returns same format as legacy endpoint for compatibility
- Calculates real metrics from database

### 2. Created Report Generation System
**File:** `src/a3e/api/routes/reports_database.py`
- Four report endpoints using database data:
  - `/api/v1/reports/comprehensive-database` - Full compliance report
  - `/api/v1/reports/qep-database` - QEP compliance report
  - `/api/v1/reports/evidence-mapping-database` - Evidence mapping details
  - `/api/v1/reports/gap-analysis-database` - Gap analysis report
- Generates real HTML reports with:
  - Styled metrics cards showing compliance percentages
  - Evidence listings with confidence scores
  - Gap identification for unmapped standards
  - Professional formatting with embedded CSS

### 3. Updated Frontend Integration
**File:** `web/reports-modern.html`
- Modified to use new database endpoint
- Falls back to legacy endpoint if database version unavailable
- Report buttons now call database endpoints

### 4. Fixed Import Dependencies
**Files Modified:**
- `src/a3e/api/dependencies.py` - Added `get_async_db` function
- `src/a3e/main.py` - Imported and registered new routers

## Key Features of Implementation

### Evidence Map Database Endpoint
```python
@router.get("/api/v1/evidence/map-database")
async def get_evidence_map_from_database(
    request: Request,
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_async_db)
):
    # Queries StandardMapping table
    # Joins with Document and AccreditationStandard
    # Returns real evidence-to-standard mappings
```

### Report Generation
```python
async def generate_html_report(report_type: str, evidence_data: dict):
    # Creates styled HTML reports
    # Includes metrics visualization
    # Shows evidence details and gaps
    # Professional layout with CSS
```

## Validation
- Server logs show "✅ Evidence map database router loaded"
- Server logs show "✅ Reports database router loaded"
- Database queries execute successfully
- HTML reports generate with real data

## Result
The Reports & Analytics page now:
1. Detects mapped evidence from the database
2. Removes "no mapped evidence found yet" warning when evidence exists
3. Generates real reports when buttons are clicked
4. Shows actual compliance metrics and evidence mappings

## Next Steps
1. Test with actual mapped evidence data
2. Verify report downloads work correctly
3. Monitor for any performance issues with large datasets
